          "Post Text": "We just lost our beloved dog, Phoebe, almost 7 hours ago. She's only 4 and had a liver failure. we/i only found out when she's already in the end stage, meaning that she's been suffering for days.\n\nDuring the early stages, my parents noticed that she's always hiding when my 1 month old niece came in to stay. The hiding occurred for weeks (she does this when someone new stays. It happened once when we brought a new puppy which soon died from an unknown cause) until she suddenly gets sick. She suddenly lost appetite and went to hiding more. Phoebe usually heads out of hiding when she hears signs of dinner time. My parents, having much focus on my niece, wasn't taking phoebe's early stages of symptoms seriously. There was this time where they saw phoebe's urine having small hints of blood. They blamed her for not drinking enough water. so what happened next is that my mother bought her this Dextrose powder for whatever reason that may help with, ignoring the signs of her having an internal problem that will slowly grow into a serious one.\n\na few days later, around 8pm, my mother called me out of my room to hold phoebe while she feeds her the dextrose thing, we noticed that her breath/mouth is smelling unpleasant(the effect of her having gum ulcer), her tummy/skin turning yellowish, and the white part of her eyes also turning yellowish. it's that time where we found out that she's having an organ failure.\n\nI told my mother that it's time to send her to the vets, but that time, it was sunday night, she has to go to work as a teacher tomorrow. so what she did was to ask my sister, the mother of my niece, to head to the last veterinary clinic they went to and ask if they're available for walk-ins (OF COURSE THEY ARE!) but it clearly didn't happen. My sister and her husband went out somewhere else the day after that night(monday).\n\nfast forward to what happend during monday. My parents found Phoebe's vomit under their bed, emitting the smell of phoebe's mouth. My father had enough and told us that \"there's no more hope for that dog\" leashing her at our 2nd floor (the rooftop) to prevent anymore mess inside the house. I went upstairs to check up on her, gave her a few pets before heading back down to my room and cry about it because i couldnt do anything about it.\n\nThe next day, Tuesday morning, the day of her passing. Everyone left the house, leaving me and Phoebe who's still leashed upstairs. I saw her, very fatigued, lying on the concrete floor. At that time, I know that her time is running out but still have enough hope in trying to save her out of her misery. so, i decided to sit and hangout with phoebe, petting her while using an AI app to do research about her sick, how critical is her condition etc. to the point that i started crying.\n\nLater on, i went down stairs to go do something, and then the moment i came back up, phoebe had been on a bowel movement while still lying down conscious, indicating that some of her organs are shutting down. I messaged my mother on what happened and begged her to send immediately phoebe out for euthanasia. She refused. she told me that \"she's already so weak, she'll eventually die\" telling me that i SHOULD just wait until she passes away. At this moment, I lost every hope i had. I became the only advocate who tried to save her from the slow and agonizing pain she's having.\n\nfew minutes later, i went back up after checking on something downstairs and i saw her, finally at rest. Tears fell as i pet her warm head one last time. I was so sad that i wasn't there at her last breath.   \n  \ni announced her death to my mother through messaging, receiving a sad reaction before telling me to put her in a rice sack and then we'll plan on her burial when she gets home.\n\nBefore putting Phoebe in the sack, i rapped her with her favorite towel, the towel we used every time we bathe her and also the one who she loves to chew on. Not just that, she also loved playing tug-of-war with it.\n\n2 and a half hours later, My mother arrived. We had a bit of a struggle to think of where we should burry her until my grandmother stepped in to recommend a nearby spot costing a fair amount of price for someone to dig a grave in.\n\nBefore i head to the place, carried the sack, my mother told me to pray for her, which warmed my heart that there's still a bit of sympathy in her from the passing of phoebe.\n\nIt was a rainy afternoon. I placed the sack containing phoebe in it, down the grave and the  guy who dug it began filling it up. The guy told me that this place is a known pet grave as some people also burried theirs in here. \n\nafter filling it up, i couldn't pray because this place is somebody's property and they can see me from their window. So what i did was walk away through the rain. I began praying for my sorrow, regret, and wish for phoebe. It was a long walk until i got back home, finishing it with an \"Amen\".\n\nPhoebe is a sweet dog. never broke our hearts until her last moment. I couldn't imagine how bad her internal pain was. her fighting as strong as she could to live another hour shows how much time she had to be saved. She was just starting her life in her prime and could have lived more and more years if it wasn't for everyone's neglect.\n\nIt's been 7 hours now as of i'm typing this and I miss her. Fly High, Phoebe. You will always live rent free from the bottom of my heart. \n\nThank you. Sorry. and Goodbye.",

She’s a certified dog trainer and spent years putting this together so new dog owners wouldn’t have to drop hundreds on classes.\n\nMost puppy preschool classes are like $150+ and only cover the basics (sit, stay, etc). And private trainers? Usually $100+ per hour. This course goes way beyond that. It teaches obedience, behavior correction, advanced tricks, and more, but you can do it all at home, at your own pace.\n\nWhat’s cool is she’s super hands on even though it’s an online course. If you're stuck on something or your pup's not getting it, you can literally send her a video or message and she’ll help you work through it, kinda like having a private trainer in your pocket.\n\nNot sure if posts like this are allowed, but figured it might help anyone bringing home a new pup soon 🙂\n\nHere's the link to check it out - [brainycanines.com](http://brainycanines.com)",

I’ll be honest that it has not been turned on for 3 years. I have 0 interest in turning it on and using it. I saw a check list that in the summer that the flue should be closed to not let your A/C out. That makes sense.\n\nSo I closed it and went to work. I’m now at work and panicking after reading more that gas ones shouldn’t be closed? After googling and trying to research for hours, I’m at a loss. Should I go home and re open it up? I have a dog at home. \n\nThe gas part has been off and not turned on for years. I currently do not have pictures, but plan to take pictures this evening and try to find out the make and model to understand it better. Do you think it’s ok and safe? The flue doesn’t have a dampener? So who knows if the previous home owners had it installed correctly or anything of the sort. Overthinking and just want to make sure to be safe.. \n\nThank you for your help!",

The injuries JOK suffered are simply not from being struck by a vehicle — yet there are many people out there (I’m seeing on social media) and in the media (Court TV) who think we are fools for believing it was a set up. I always go back to the injuries and no matter how difficult it is to believe it was a set up, to me the injuries are irrefutable. JOK got into a fight and was also attacked by a dog. Period. I don’t understand why the naysayers don’t see it. \n\nThe woman in the WI case was acquitted in just 4 hours. I believe she knew she at least clipped her husband but did not realize she fatally injured him. Her husband was frozen by morning in similar temps  as it was in Canton — yet JOK was still alive when he was discovered after being outside nearly as long as John Philips in the WI case (with JOK being in the snow about an hour less) — essentially proof JOK was not in the snow all night. \n\nI’m hoping we will someday know what actually happened to JOK — I suspect the truth will be far simpler and with less involvement from others than we may think and certainly than Brian Albert suggested. \n",

          "Post Text": "# Chapter 1 Nightmare “AHHH.” A deep groan broke from the Night Stalker Club office as I passed by.\n\nFucktastic! A loud thud followed, vibrating the door. This was fucking ridiculous. Call me old-fashioned, but they could do it at home before they came over. I quickened my pace toward the entrance of the rooftop. Sex noise didn’t surprise me, but considering my friends were the ones making those noises, it was awkward. I couldn’t listen to that. I couldn’t blame them if they wanted a quick fuck with their wives though. They had the best lives, but ignoring the stabbing pain settling in my chest was hard. At the rooftop, the sun just sat down from the horizon. My eyes were steady as I watched the red, orange, and yellow colors before the twilight beckoning the sky. Those colors reminded me of fire, passion, danger, energy, happiness, and hope. I leaned my elbows against the concrete parapet, flicked the ash from my cigarette, and breathed in the remaining inch I lit up while watching for the sun to set. The lights started to scintillate around me to somehow light up the darkness surrounding the city. I stubbed the butt till it stopped smoking. Exhaust and city pollution came back to life.\n\nI knew people said cigarette smoking was dangerous to your health, but this thing was a reminder that life wasn’t fair. People thought I was a weird shit to choose a deadly companion than a woman—that I didn’t have a beating organ in my body, that I was an ice king if that even existed. What they didn’t know was, I was a good guy, that I didn’t even like this another part of me, but it grew inside me already, and I had to embrace it for some reason.\n\nThe thing was, hard life taught me to be prepared.\n\nThe only question was, would I ever want to be that person anymore? The old version of myself—when I felt I was a better version of who I was today?\n\nI walked down and met the nightclub manager, Kyland in the locker room. I quickly cleared my mind and pretended I didn’t hear what happened earlier.\n\n“Bro.” He patted my back.\n\n“Hey.” I wore my black button-down shirt and rolled each sleeve above my elbows. My tattoo peeked out. It was an orange flame full of anger with black smoke swirled from my wrists up to my arms.\n\n“How’s your trip?”\n\n“Great. Thanks for arranging my sched.”\n\n“Anytime.”\n\n“Got to go to work. Bills won’t pay itself.” I wore my black apron with the club logo and walked out.\n\nThe former notorious playboy, Pyke Hughes, the club owner didn’t give a damn about the uniform. I was glad he preferred black.\n\nThe main bar had its dimly-lit dived with only yellow lights emblazoned from the low ceiling. Monday was not the busiest, but the customers entered in somewhat rush as soon as the club sign lit open.\n\nThe music visualizer from the 3D walls created colorful particles in balls shaped that synchronized to the beat of the 90’s pop song played by the DJ from the booth towering the dance floor.\n\nThe lady in a black dress ordered a dry martini, taking a seat on the dark barstool. Her makeup was simple as if she just came from long hours of work. She tapped her colorless perfectly manicured nails\n\nagainst the bar counter leisurely. Based on her dress, she didn’t come here to flirt and walk out with a man wrapping around her slender waist and have a wild night, but she was waiting for someone to arrive. Perhaps a friend.\n\nI grabbed the cocktail shaker, filling it with ice, gin, and vermouth I took from the back bar. I stirred it for a few seconds. Placing down the martini glass on the counter, I strained the mix and garnished it with olives. “Here you go, ma’am.”\n\nShe gave me a polite smile, muttering thank you.\n\nAfter working for more than two years as a bartender, I’d learned quite a few, and not only on mixing drinks but also the different types of people; from rich kids, playboy, bad boy, flirt ladies, cheating husband, horny guys, brokenhearted, dirty business, and sex, but I also developed a good relationship with my friends despite cynical behavior.\n\nI placed down the order for table-four.\n\n“I got this.” Dice, my barback took the tray with drinks to the couple at the dark red C shaped lounge chair with a half-moon-shaped silver table. With only a red light illuminated around the area, it was perfect for lovers and lonely hearts.\n\nI did my job, and time passed by like a blur. Sometimes, I wanted it that way—it made me forget something I had in mind for the time being.\n\n“Wanna stay for a while?” Kyland asked, opening a bottle of beer.\n\nI shook my head.\n\nOur boss didn’t leave yet either. Pyke settled in front of the bar counter, grabbing the beer that Kyland had just opened. “Thanks, Wright!”\n\n“That’s mine, man.” Kyland groaned.\n\nI chuckled inwardly. They were literally brothers-in-law now. Pyke married Camila, Kyland’s cousin.\n\n“Wanna take it back? Go ahead.” Pyke raised the beer to offer back and laughed while Kyland was glaring back at him. “Then go grab another one.”\n\n“Can’t take for your own, dude?” Kyland scowled.\n\n“What’s gotten into you, Wright? Does your wife not good at giving you orgasms?” Pyke teased.\n\nI had to blink back the thought of what had just happened earlier because if my memory served right, Pyke was quite clueless of them almost bringing down the door.\n\n“Leave her alone, Hughes!”\n\nThey talked about sex quite often when they were both single and might have shared women before. I had no idea. They quitted the moment they were in their serious relationship. I guessed people did change because no one had seen it coming that Pyke and Kyland stopped their sexual escapades.\n\nHow about you, Wood? When are you going to have sex? What I mean sex, the hardcore kind, kinky, and dirty. Have you lost your guymen yet?” Pyke smirked at me.\n\nKyland snorted. “Are you trying to liberate him?”\n\n“Just trying to figure him out, Wright.”\n\nThey might have a few thought I didn’t like women or I was into dick, but who gave a shit?\n\nI shrugged it off. “My sexual exploitation is just fine.”\n\n“Really? Do you have a girlfriend? I know you’re not married, but I never saw you going out of the club with a woman either. Waiting for a perfect girl, huh?” Pyke faced me, piquing his interest.\n\nI shook my head. “No girlfriend. No wife. But I can assure you I have a sex life.”\n\nKyland and Pyke burst into laughter, high-fiving each other.\n\n“Then why do you ask for days off every last week of the month?” Of course, Pyke would ask.\n\n“I have to travel to see my family.” I only had a long conversation with them when they invited me during a weekend or if it was not a work-related topic. I thought they respected my privacy and never asked personal questions, but I caught Pyke often intently staring at me as if he was studying what was behind my facade.\n\n“Of course.” He nodded subtly, seemed not to buy my reason.\n\nAfter bidding goodbye, I walked out of the employee exit to where I parked my Onyx black 2001 Chevy Camaro Z28. I checked my phone for a call from someone as soon as I got inside. Zero.\n\nI pressed the music icon on the screen of the GPS. Instantly, Simple Man played over the Bose speakers. I pulled out into the driveway, tapping my fingers on the wheel to the beat of the old rock music.\n\nNot less than an hour, I arrived at my pad. My pad was secured by an advanced security system that I installed myself. It had a camera on the peephole that no one would even notice. I inserted the key and pressed my thumb above the door handle with a small black square for fingerprint scanning. In less than three seconds, the door clicked unlocked. noveldrama\n\nI locked the door after double-checking to make sure things were in the right places. I chose the colors according to my preferences—black, gray, and white. The dark gray curtain was drawn to block the\n\nlight from the outside of the floor to ceiling glass window.\n\nExhaustion took over me. I’d been awake for more than twenty-hours now. I slumped body to my authentic crocodile skin couch and kicked my shoes off and massaged my temples.\n\nMy mind went back to my phone. No call. I hit the number on my speed dial and it was picked up right away considering the timezone there. “Any update?”\n\nBill Lioner, my tech geek presented our proposal to the Diabetic Research Center in New York two months ago about our proposed project, the Advanced Insulin Glucose Monitoring System or AIGMS. Unfortunately, they turned it down.\n\nAs much as I didn’t want to disappoint him, I couldn’t let his hope high. But if he believed in me and this project, I should at least believe in what we did. I knew Bill and his team worked their asses hard to get this deal. I just hoped it paid their effort.\n\n“We’re halfway through it. We could use a brain you know-\n\n“I am busy.” I cut off Bill. His brain was more than enough for the project, and he knew it. “That’s why everyone is paid handsomely.”\n\n“Right.” I could feel his disappointment even from a hundred miles away. “I’ll email you for the update after two months.”\n\n“Make it after two weeks. I’ll arrange a video conference.”\n\n“T-That’s impossible,” he stammered.\n\n“I am not in a patient mode right now, Lioner. Make it possible.” My voice came out sharp. Bill even gasped from the other end of the line, and he was aware that we were almost running out of time\n\n“Absolutely, sir.” I knew how much this project meant for him. If we could make a breakthrough, he would be the first to get the benefit since he’d been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes back in college.\n\n“Good.” Before I could hang up, something came up my mind. “Bill, I’m sorry.”\n\n“It’s alright, sir.\n\n“I actually have an idea. I don’t know if it’s possible.”\n\n“I’m listening. Nothing is impossible, Forrest.”\n\nI couldn’t help but smile when he called my name. “Let’s say you’re right. Is it possible to put the monitor and the treatment together?”\n\n“You’re saying—”\n\n“I know it sounds crazy—”\n\n“Brilliant! Call me after a week.”\n\nMy brow met in confusion. “Okay?” I hung up the call. Instantly, my lids felt heavy.\n\n“Mama! Mama!” I shouted as I ran toward our burning house.\n\nPeople from our small village were already in chaos with buckets of water to cease the fire. I bit the hairy arm who tried to stop me, then ran faster as soon as I freed myself. I slammed the door with my body and ignored them yelling my name because I knew my mama was trapped inside.\n\n“Mama!” I coughed furiously. My eyes stung, tears streaming down my flushed face. I couldn’t see anything other than the thick dark smoke coming from the kitchen.\n\n“Mama!” I blindly walked and used my hands as my guide.\n\nI opened my eyes slowly the moment I reached the kitchen doorjamb. It was difficult to watch the scorching of huge flame devouring Mama’s cabinet filled with her Chinaware collections. It was like watching a starving animal eating its prey with an enormous appetite.\n\n“Mama!” I shouted, running to where my mama was crawling out under our old wooden table, where we shared many meals. Her swollen eyes were pleading, filled with horror, sadness, and pain.\n\n“G-go, m-my s-sweet boy. S-save yourself,” Mama choked her words out, making me shake to cry.\n\nThere was blood everywhere—on her beautiful face, her favorite white blouse, and on her hands as she pushed me away from her.\n\n“Mama! No, Mama!” I gripped her wrists, dragging her out under the table, but she was too heavy, and she was pulling her hands out of my grip.\n\nI cried for help, but there were no words came out, instead, I continued coughing as the black smoke entered and burned my lungs, making me wheeze and breathe harder. I quickly crawled under the table, ignoring the unbearable heat against my skin that I felt I was melting under. I covered my mama with my body, closed my eyes, and took the fate that was written for me.\n\nThe flame reached the table quickly, to my shirt and licked my skin greedily. The pain was excruciating, and I was helpless to fight.\n\n# Chapter 2 Fired\n\nMEGAN\n\nSuckstastic!\n\nIT HAD been eight days since I lost my job. Eight days of wallowing in self-pity at the four corners of my apartment—alone. And every time I closed my eyes, all I saw was the image flickering of my evil boss as he tried to violate me. He was a shameless piece of shit and thought I would just welcome his loser dick because he had one.\n\nSince I kneed him on his balls and punched his wrinkled ugly face, I hadn’t seen or heard from him again. I was immensely grateful and scared at the same time that cops would just knock on my door informing me that someone sued me for assault.\n\nI’d never been violent in my entire life, in fact, I was always a victim. Then I saw red when he tried to do that thing that I was scared of. My instinct kicked in, and I did what I thought was right to save a little morality I had left.\n\nIt was passed six when I got out of my bed. I tried hard to ignore my urge to call Camila and Bianca because I knew they were both busy with their husbands. And at this time, Blaine was busy playing with Ben and Sammy—who wouldn’t? those kids were adorable. Lucky for them, they met men who respected, loved and treasured them like true gems. But luck was not on my side though, and I doubted if I could trust my heart to any man over again.\n\nI checked my phone, of course, no calls, no messages—no one cared. Naught.\n\nMy life sucks!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Night Stalker Club was crowded. The noises always made me feel alive, reminding me that I still had a reason to live despite my life had been turned upside down a couple of times, reeled and grief- stricken—I still managed to pull myself together. Yay to me!\n\nI passed through the crowd and approached the bar. Thankfully, I found an empty barstool and rested my elbows on the dark counter, tapping my blood red-colored nails as if I wasn’t drowning with self-pity earlier.\n\nMy heart was speeding up in a second of anticipation as I scanned around, but I couldn’t find him. Was he off work today?\n\n“Caipirinha, please?”\n\nDice, a bartender with Afro head nodded. The staff knew me through Camila and Pyke. I hummed to the pop song played by the DJ at his booth.\n\nA few moments later, Dice placed down my drink and placed another order from the man beside me who wore a strong perfume. I turned my head slightly to check him out. He was wearing a sophisticated tailored suit with shiny personalized cuff links. He was rich, probably had his own office in Manhattan business district.\n\nHe raised his Jack on the rocks to acknowledge me and sipped it, then slightly turned to face me.\n\nI smiled timidly and sipped my Brazilian drink, and let the grassy herbaceous taste of cachaça washed over my loneliness. Wash, huh? Ridiculous!\n\n“Hi,” he prompted, smiling confidently. You’re rich but not attractive. I don’t feel all tingly.\n\nI must say though, this man was tall and physically fit, but I didn’t come here tonight to flirt and get laid just to get rid of this sorrow churning inside me. I still couldn’t forget what that dipshit did to me. I\n\nguessed I was born jinx after all.\n\n“I’m waiting for someone.” I crossed my legs to avoid touching his knees.\n\n“He should be here by now. Shouldn’t let a beautiful woman wait.” He raised an eyebrow, testing. Oh, god! Stop flirting already.\n\nI wanted to roll my eyes, instead, I smiled. “What made you think I am waiting for a... man?”\n\nHis eyes glinted wickedly. “As gorgeous as you.” He strolled his gaze from my face to my chest, to my exposed thighs. “It would be a waste.”\n\n“You’re maybe right, but I am really waiting for someone.”\n\n“At least let me entertain you while you’re waiting for his grand entrance.” Back off, already! Your cufflinks are too shiny for my taste. He extended his hand. “Asher.” Oh, come on! Aren’t you a little persistent?\n\nI reluctantly raised my hand to shake his.\n\n“Megan.”\n\nStartled, I choked on my heart and my pulse pounded in my ears. My head snapped to the strong and deep voice behind the bar.\n\nForrest had his dark eyes narrowed at me so intense that made me gulp, with dark thick brows squished together. His straight nose was flaring, his jaw was locked tight that made his jawline sharper. noveldrama\n\n“Il est tellement chaud.” I thought it was my voice.\n\nHis gaze made my knees tremble. This man always carried the pain, mystery, and broody character, but he was damn beautiful with his imperfection. His powerful presence caught me hyper-aware that\n\nhad my body tense and my vagina shamelessly reacted. Oops! I shouldn’t have thought of that. Too late, Megan.\n\n“Forrest.” I coughed his name.\n\nHe took a few moments to somewhat assess me before he talked again. “You okay?\n\nI nodded. Suddenly, it came to my senses that I’d been staring at him for a couple of seconds and not saying anything. It was always this way.\n\n“Yeah.” My word came unsure.\n\n“Can I get you another drink?” He looked down at my almost empty glass.\n\nMy hand turned shaky as I pushed the glass toward him. “Yes, please.”\n\nA man on my left side cleared his throat. I completely forgot I was about to shake his hand. “So, you’re Megan.”\n\nI glanced at him. “He’s here.”\n\n“Wait a sec. You’re dating that bartender?” Did I say anything about dating? He gestured his head to the magnificent back of Forrest who was wearing a black shirt, sleeves were rolled up his elbows, showing off his flames tattooed that I found it intriguing and sexy.\n\nI preferred a clean guy, but it just looked damn good on him. Sometimes I wondered if he had a few more tattoos underneath the dark shirt he was wearing. Did his abs or deep V covered with tattoos as well or did he have a piercing on his flagpole? Bad bad girl, Meggie.\n\nI leisurely watched his biceps bulged as he busied himself mixing. “Nope.”\n\n“Your brother then?”\n\nI snapped my head and stared at the man for good seconds. I opened my mouth, but before I could speak, Forrest placed the drink in front of me.\n\n“Back off, dude. You’re not her type.” Forrest’s voice was deep and harsh, but I could feel that was intentional.\n\n“You’re one to talk.”\n\n“What do you think?”\n\nMy mouth slacked open and parched because Forrest didn’t even open his mouth if he didn’t have to. He was a man of a few words. He used to brood than to spend his time talking to someone like this pompous dumbass beside me.\n\nForrest always intrigued us. I just didn’t have the gut to even talk to him if I didn’t have a choice. He intimidated me like a predator, but something deep inside me triggered every time we locked our gazes —it was like rolling of thunder with warmth and desire, but I had to keep it to myself because he was a friend in my circles. But boy, that’s a damn shame because he looks so good.\n\n“You’re a bartender, dude. Don’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong. I am just asking a beautiful lady over here—”\n\n“Just like you asked another beautiful lady yesterday?”“What is your problem?”\n\n“My problem? Didn’t she tell you she was waiting for someone?” Oh, he heard me?\n\nMy eyes ping-ponged between them while I was trying to process that they were arguing because of me, yet, I couldn’t tell them to stop.\n\nClearly, Forrest pissed off Asher. The dude’s face was flaming red and stoned hard. “I can make a complaint against your rudeness behavior and make sure you can’t find another job even sweeping dog shits in the street.”\n\n“And I am so shaking,” Forrest answered confidently.\n\n“Asshole!” Asher barked harshly.\n\n“You’re not the first time to call me that.” He grabbed the empty glass on my left and a few dollar bills.\n\n“Forrest, what are you doing?” I asked him, finally finding my voice to speak.\n\n“I don’t know,” he mumbled under his breath, then pinned his gaze at me.\n\n“You could be in trouble.”\n\n“Who gives a damn? What are you doing here? Alone.”\n\n“I’m a customer.” I shrugged.\n\nForrest shifted his gaze to my back, and I noticed Asher left his stool.\n\n“This is for you, asshole.” He threw the bills toward the counter then walked away.\n\nForrest picked them up from the floor, then Asher’s empty glass.\n\nI waited until he would talk to me again, but he kept himself busy with the other customers and never came back to me as if I didn’t exist anymore, and it pissed me off. He passed by me when he had to take orders. The rest of the evening remained uneventful.\n\nFeeling insignificant, I drained my drink empty. After a few deep breaths, I pulled myself together, took a few bills from my clutch and placed it on the counter.\n\nWhat happened to me? I wasn’t this attention seeker. I could get attention from any man I wanted. I had a fair share, but I knew that they only wanted one thing from me, and that was what I hated myself for. Or perhaps, I wanted something more. Something else. Or more so, someone. I shook the images of my past life as they passed by in a slow blur and walked out of the club, hoping not to return.\n\nI stayed inside my car for a while, resting my head against the headrest. I couldn’t let my failures consumed me. I needed to find a job, moved on, and forgot those damages happened in my past.\n\nI couldn’t depend on my friends every time I had a problem—we weren’t like before anymore. They had priorities than to listen to my sad life stories that no one could fix it other than me.\n\nPeople thought I had a perfect life because what they saw in me was the flirty and funny Megan, and not the damaged woman behind these walls I built years ago.\n\nI started my car when my eyes started to blur. So much for an emotionally unavailable bitch! A knock had my head snapped to my window.\n\n“Megan?”\n\n**If you like Reading Full story free of cost  tell me in comments and follow me for many more.**",

          "Post Text": "At the beginning of the year my SO and I had to return to 5-days in office after we had just adopted a young puppy late last year. We found a reliable doggy daycare that she goes to now and the staff there have all been wonderful.\n\nLast Wednesday my husband called me on my way home from work. I was stopping at the grocery store and he had picked up our pup. He asked if I would want to pick up fast food and sounded sad, so I asked if everything was okay. He sighed and said, “Yeah just something at (dog’s) daycare today made me really sad so I’m not motivated to eat well today.”\n\nWhen I got home he told me what he witnessed when he came in to get our dog that afternoon. Apparently the staff at the front desk was desperately trying to reach a dog’s owner. The dog in question was a senior who had been dropped off that day for month-long boarding. He was in frail health and was already having a medical emergency - throwing up blood. We both agreed it was suspicious that the owners dropped him THAT DAY - so I doubt they were already out of country - and weren’t picking up.\n\nWe both admitted we thought the worst - that the owners dropped him with the daycare on purpose for the end of his life because they didn’t want to be there for it. Then we felt guilty for assuming what we thought was the worst. (Guess what? It gets worse.)\n\nYesterday when I came in to pick up our puppy I saw the owner there and inquired how things were going with that dog. He had been on my mind and I was hoping maybe it was a misunderstanding. Well, it wasn’t.\n\nThey finally reached the owners who told the daycare not to take their dog to the emergency vet because they didn’t want to pay the extra fee. The man claimed he spoke to his vet (a locally known and respected vet) and to just bring the dog in on Monday to its normal vet IF IT WAS STILL ALIVE.\n\nMy jaw hit the floor so fucking fast on that one. Luckily the owner is a longtime dog owner, breeder, and trainer. She’s run this facility for decades and is friends with this vet, whom she then immediately called.\n\nThe vet said the dog is 14 years old and has leukemia - and has had it awhile. Not only was the dog taken to an emergency vet and given proper medication, but the vet also shared she had told the owners if they insisted on keeping the timing of this trip that they needed to have plans for “final moments” in place for what to do if the dog passes while they’re gone.\n\nSo their solution? Board the dog and abandon it for what is likely its final month alive.\n\nI can only describe the overwhelming desire to beat the pulp out of these people I don’t know as seething.\n\nIt happens that the dog is in a boarding room that I can look into from the lobby so the ladies at the front desk can see him at all times. The owner assured me the staff goes in to see him multiple times a day and he has pain killers to help now and medication. But when I looked in the window the dog looked so fucking hopeless.\n\nHe’s 14. His snout is fully white, he’s some kind of lab box with cloudy eyes. He was laying on his side just staring at the wall listlessly and his eyes looked so fucking sad. Like he lost all hope.\n\nI haven’t stopped thinking about him. I talked to my husband and we agree that he’s in the best hands probably right now with a staff who can attend to him around the clock. The daycare owner has assumed responsibility for his medical decisions since she and the vet are working together but it’s incredibly likely this is the end of this dog’s life.\n\nI want so bad to take this dog home but there’s many, many reasons I can’t. We can’t be home with him all day. We have multiple dogs, not just the young one, and I don’t think we can provide care better than the daycare. But fuck, who does that?! Fourteen years with a dog and you drop him like hot potatoes and skip to Europe when he’s dying?\n\nOh and the owner said they would rather the dog die at the facility FYI. They don’t want to pay the fee for euthanasia. BUT YET EUROPE FOR A MONTH IS FINE.\n\nI tell you, hell isn’t enough for some people.\n\nI saw the dog again this morning and he was curled in the tiniest ball still looking so despaired. All I wanted to do was crawl in that room with him and hold him tight and tell him he wasn’t alone. I know the daycare staff check on him a lot throughout the day and even from how they treated our pup when she was very young, they’re very caring people.  But I don’t know how you can see an animal that despaired and not feel your own heart bleed some.\n\nI ordered a plush memory foam dog bed, a relaxing water fountain, and a little battery-operated anxiety stuffy that mimics slow breathing for him. I don’t know what else you get a dog to make it comfortable near the end, honestly.\n\nThe daycare owner said they don’t need anything but I just want to help him be comfortable if I can.\n\nI’m sitting in my office now, two hours into my work day and I still can’t stop thinking about him. I think I’m going to ask the daycare owner how much it would be if they do have to put the dog down more humanely to see if I can help offset the facility’s expenses some.\n\nMy husband is worried if the dog does die the owners will try to come back and blame the daycare somehow, but the owner mentioned all her communication with them has been through text. Including the owner saying they should just “let the dog die” there.\n\nOh and if you’re the owners reading this from Europe…I truly hope life gives you the shit end of the stick one day. And NEVER get a dog again, please.",

Det har været en god oplevelse, og det meste af tiden er det gået rigtig fint.\n\nNu er han startet i børnehave – i samme institution – og her møder han nogle nye udfordringer.\n\nHan vil virkelig gerne være sammen med de andre børn, men han har svært ved at rumme, at der er 18-20 børn på stuen. Nogle gange slår han ud efter et andet barn uden nogen tydelig grund. Det hjælper ham meget at få en middagslur – det giver ham en mental pause.

Bad therapy, not taking movement seriously and injuries after made it worse. In the last year I have made the best and most significant progress. Now I was never a flexible person. Still struggle with even touching my knees on a forward fold sitting down. I grew up heavy, never did sports and pretty much sat around everyday after school. \n\nI started working out about 2 years before my accident. total of 7 years working out but obviously with chronic back pain it was back and forth to PT and rest. I ended up discovering pilates, I was never a believer in it. Thought lifting weights was my only way to get fit. Pilates honestly saved me. I was bed ridden and months away from my last resort being back surgery. Just got back into weight lifting though and feeling pretty good. I know myself way better.\n\nNow I still struggle and have flare ups but this is the best I've ever felt. I have basically no flexibility. I feel like my spine just wants to be upright. My downward dogs are tight(heels never touch ground) and so are my cobra poses, can't even do a real normal squat with heels on the ground.. I was curious about belly dancing. Since pilates helped me learn more about my body and how to feel it/move, I was wondering if you guys would suggest learning belly dancing for someone like me? It just seems like you all become so in touch with yourself and understand your body?? I'd love to be able to move the freely like you guys do. \n\nThanks if you read all of this and replied:)))))",

I can’t see any outright antisemitism coming from Mamdani and while there have been potential dog whistles, I think it’s grasping at straws at best. \n\nOne thing that’s unclear to me is how Lander fits in all of this. Is it because NYC citizens should have the choice between the two best progressive candidates and both of them are poised to be top of the ranked choices?\n\nAlso, I’m sure there is a YouTube link of this conversation so I apologize if you so t use TikTok.

She gives the camera a dirty look and says \"Shoo!\" Camera shakily moves and focuses on Shady wearing her usual top hat and spiral pelt, her kindred fang earings and lupine claw/ tooth necklace and off the shoulder blouse talking with Rose cuddled up next to her wearing a red leather vest and leggings, spiral tooth jewelry and feather earings swaying as she teases the Baron.*\n\n*Talon argues with Oglivie off to the side where the bets are placed dressed in a cut up Iron Maiden shirt and jeans, Tyler stands not too far off, piercings reflecting in the dim lights. George stands there screaming her head off in her typical wool cap and army jacket. Mia dressed in her fur coat and leathers stares at George and shakes her head, her piercings reflecting with each shake. Next to her Lucius chuckles, his bald head extra shiny and tattoos peaking through the black tank top he wears.*\n\n*camera shakily pans to RK wearing a tight black T shirt and jeans, hair in her usual braids talking to Jason wearing a Bongo t-shirt and flight pants laughing easily*\n\n*Oglivie ignores Talon and stands \"Bets!! Bets!! Our returning Cammie Brawn who's one for one taking on Harper fighting for the Anarchs! Place'em now people!\" Talon throws his hands in the air annoyed and angrily stalks away*\n*Richter walks up to VIP area in his usual white silk shirt and leather pants ( and movie star chin) followed by Airbox's huge form in his typical letterman jacket and jeans. And speaks with the Baron asking where she finds these Amazons eyeing Rose. Shady smirks and shrugs \"Lucky I guess.\" The camera person giggles shaking the camera pans to Shady who holds up a claw to Oglivie who nods and writes something down. \"Gonna hurt Brawns feelings\" Richter says. Shady shrugs \"Gotta bet on my cousin and besides maybe Brawn will finally convert to our side\" laughter.*\n\n*Oglivie closes the bets as The Rocky theme plays and Brawn a huge Nosferatu enters wearing his signature cap, white tank top, jeans and fingerless gloves left side of his face horribly disfigured. He raises his hands to the crowd who roars*\n\n*Then The Smashing Pumpkins's \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\" plays and Harper comes down wearing her hair in a ponytail  dressed in a sports top, tight shorts, and sneakers. The scales on her chest are visible, and she wears her dog tags with a Star of David on the same chain.*\n\n*Harper, a head taller than Brawn, approaches him in the ring. She extends her arms, fists closed and knuckles towards Brawn. He pauses for a second, caught off guard by the boxing handshake as if he wasn’t expecting it. He eventually taps his knuckles to her before he steps back into a stance, his fists close to him. Harper tries a few quick stance changes, starting low like a Gangrel before standing up in a stance mirroring Brawn’s. The match begins.*\n\n*Harper moves first, left hook coming into his side, hitting his ribs. The hammering blow causes a cracking sound to be heard as ribs break. No Potence is used, yet, but Harper is a heavyweight for a reason.\nBrawn jabs a counterattack at Harper’s abdomen and she is already moving. She dodges but she’s yanked off balance, as if moving faster than she was expecting. She recovers quickly but is immediately met by a follow-up jab straight for her face. She cannot move out of the way and Brawn’s fist connects.*\n\n*The blow is loud, silencing the crowd, augmented by Potence, but Harper doesn’t move. Doesn’t even flinch. She smiles as blood runs down from a small cut on her cheek. There’s a flash of red across the sclera surrounding her green cat eyes as she starts pumping the Blood. She immediately follows with a sharp jab into his inner right knee. He hops back, not quite fast enough as her fist glances off his kneecap.*\n\n*Brawn’s balance is off-kilter now. Harper’s grin gets bigger as she knows this fight’s hers. Deciding to end it now, she bends her knees and gets low, uncurling her fingers. The nails on her hands elongate to long, scythe-like black talons, half-a-foot in length each.*\n\n*She lunges forward and low, slashing the back of his left leg with her right hand. His leg gives out, and he falls to one knee. Now, the coup de grâce: her left hand shoots forward in a wicked jab, claws impaling his chest. She lifts him one handed, snarling, a barely contained frenzy, above her head at full height before slamming him into the ground, back first, the tips of her claws going through and into the floor beneath him. The back of his head smacks wetly into the ground, and he does not stir.*\n\n*Her claws retreat as she stands, blood pumping. The whites of her eyes are bloodshot, the fight making her use more than she was expecting. The rust shaken out of her, she exalts in her victory… for now.*",

My mom (my dad has been in and out of the picture, but is not permanently out) knows that my ideal teenage-hood would’ve been in the same house that I grew up in, with at least one childhood friend, the same neighbourhood, the same dog, two parents, cheerleading etc etc. At least, I think she’s observant enough to recognise that. Please don’t misconstrue this as me not being grateful. My mom did the absolute best she could with the resources that she had and i’m incredibly grateful and proud of everything she has done for me AND I wish it could’ve been different. Anyway, she’s been asking me what’s up all day and I was wondering if you would want to hear the truth, straight up? I wasn’t going to tell her as it’s not affecting my mental health and I feel as though it may cause upset- like i said, she did the best she could, but she does like to know things and I do think about it often. \n\nEDIT: I won’t go into specific details about my life because I don’t think it’s necessary, but I do think it’s helpful to include that i’m homeschooled.

I also have an 11 year old male cat.\n\nWe moved out of the city about a year and a half ago at this point and we're now nestled on half an acre in a much more rural area. The dogs LOVE having so much room to run around and the cat has endless window sills to lounge around in and sunbathe. They've all been loving it here...until the fleas invaded earlier this year.\n\n  \nFor context, as my older guy has aged, he's developed issues with regular hotspots. He's always had really sensitive skin. Generally, they haven't been hard to treat or get him to stop licking at and they've historically gone away pretty quickly. The younger dog has never had any skin issues and has the healthiest skin/coat I've ever seen. My cat has always had healthy skin/fur as well. He is absolutely terrified of anyone that isn't me or my husband, and I'm his favorite of the 2 household humans. \n\nThe second it started getting warm earlier this year, it has been a complete hostile takeover of fleas that we cannot seem to shake. It's been months and I feel like an absolutely awful pet owner for not being able to mitigate this problem effectively. We've done regular cycles of literally everything that has been recommended - we've tried baths, exterminators, diatomaceous earth, flea combing, flea preventative treatments, the collars, we've thrown away dog beds and rugs, done furniture treatments,...you name it, we've tried it. We've dropped upwards towards thousands of dollars in attempting to stop this over the past few months with no luck. At this point, living with &amp; treating the fleas is starting to feel like a full time job.\n\nMy poor boys are in misery. The younger of the two dogs (who has a fuller, fluffier coat) is not really having as much of an issue with it. However, my older animals are really struggling. My older dog with the sensitive skin is chewing on his tail and the spot on his \"ankle\" just above his front foot pads to the point of there being raw bald spots that I have been working diligently with to ensure they don't get infected. My cat is now overgrooming and constantly scratching. The cat is so miserable that he won't let me anywhere near him to clip his nails and he isn't using scratchers enough right now for his nails to be a safe self-grooming length, so he is constantly scratching himself to the point of bleeding (I'm trying to ensure his don't get infected as well).\n\nThis past week, it also seems like both dogs have either developed an ear infection or an ear mite issue. One of their ears each is producing so much stinky, dark brown wax and they're itching on that ear a lot. When I use cleaning pads on them, they both lean their whole body weight into my hand and groan with relief. I'm being mindful not too over-clean their ears and I have this ear drop treatment but it doesn't seem to be working effectively.\n\nI genuinely don't know what to do here and I am being kept up all night long tormented by their discomfort, endlessly looking up any remedies and treatments I can possibly find. They're in so much discomfort that the animals are starting to get snippy with each other, which isn't ideal. Any advice at all is greatly appreciated, I feel awful for my sweet pets. They mean the world to me and seeing them like this is killing me.",

          "Post Text": "For a long while I have been feeling bored by Zen. The problem was that Zen didn't feel personal anymore, or urgent in any way. It didn't feel alive.\n\nMy conception of Zen was simple: Zen is about original completeness, about trust in your own mind, and about not being tied down to any concepts. A very comforting view, but in a way it's too pacifying. If it's just this, Zen is dead and boring.\n\nBut I've come to a realization that made Zen come alive again: True Zen is personal and dangerous. It's found in our confrontation with existential danger in every moment. Existential danger isn’t about physical threat, but it’s the exposure of being fully alive without hiding and without self-deception.\n\nHow did the Buddha become enlightened? He thought about sickness, aging, and death. A confrontation with existential danger. And what did he find? He didn't \"cure\" these afflictions in a conventional, biological sense: he still died a biological death after all. He found that we must unite with this existential danger to be truly alive.\n\n&gt;Zhaozhou asked Touzi, \"How is it when a man who has died the great death returns to life?\" Touzi said, \"He must not go by night: he must get there in daylight.\"\n\nPreviously this case puzzled me. Now it's obvious: Traveling at night is hiding. You sneak in the dark so nobody can see you. The man who died the great death and returns to life, a Buddha, must arrive in daylight. He can't hide from life. By not hiding, he exposes himself to the dangers of the world.\n\n&gt;One day at Nanquan's the eastern and western halls were arguing over avcat. When Nanquan saw this, he took and held it up and said, \"If you can speak I won't cut it.\" The group had no reply; Nanquan then cut the cat in two.\n\nIn this case, Nanquan confronst his monks with death. The monks probably thought he can't be serious, he's gonna let the cat go after all. It's against the precepts, he wouldn't do that. His monks were not ready, they could not act from a place of existential danger. And Nanquan is a dangerous guy.\n\n&gt;Linji said to the assembly, \"There is a true man with no rank always going out and in through the portals of your face. Beginners who have not yet witnessed it, look! Look!\" Then a monk came forward and said, \"What is the true man of no rank?\" Linji got down from the seat, grabbed and held him: the monk hesitated. Linji pushed him away and said, \"The true man of no rank--what a piece of dry crap he is!\"\n\nLinji is a dangerous guy too. He grabs the monk, tries to pull him directly into the moment of existential danger. Zen masters are dangerous because they confront people directly. They don't allow people to deceive themselves and avoid the truth. The truth that is always staring us in the face at every moment. The monk isn't ready though, what a dry piece of shit.\n\n&gt;Venerable Zhaozhou: because a monk asked, \"Is the puppy also Buddha Nature or not?\" Zhou said, \"Not.\"\n\nThe most famous case ever. Zhaozhou denies that all beings are originally complete. That puts us into existential danger. It removes the comforting concept that we must be originally complete (and thus safe). We can't rely on that to give us comfort in the face of reality.\n\nWhy is it that dialogue is the main practice of Zen? It's simple: Zen masters invite the danger. The danger of being exposed to public scrutiny. They enjoy being questioned and having the metaphorical knife at their throat. Fakers can't do it: they need to hide. They must travel at night and avoid the daylight.\n\nTrue Zen must be personal and dangerous. We must travel in the light and not hide from life. And we cannot rely on conceptual understanding as a crutch or for comfort. \n\nIt's alive, it's alive!",

While I took a call, I forgot to lock the door to the outside which has a paddle handle, (not a \"button\" like it says in the paperwork) and she jumped up, hit it, and let herself out. I realized what happened 2-2 1/2 hours later and let her in immediately. Panting, drank a load of water, laid down, just wouldn't stop panting with her ears back. So I took her to the hospital.\n\nAt discharge around 10PM (9:46AM now) they said she was back within normal body temperature and was mildly dehydrated.  The doctor was comfortable with letting her be taken home.\n\nThis morning she still seems weak, wanderng around the kitchen with what sounds like mildly labored breathing, she ate all her food and is still drinking, but didnt go to the bathroom outside with the other dogs. Earlier I heard her yelping a little trying to get up, and I feel like her back legs are weak. \n\nThe doctor told me they put her on painkillers, a \"mild sedative\", took blood, and gave her a catheter. I just don't know if she's still recovering from treatment or if something is still wrong. I'm angry at myself for not letting her stay for observation. What do I do?",

But this leads to his bitching about my talking to “Kelvin” like he somehow owns me.  Scammers hate competition and as subsequent conversations reveal, George was right to be wary.\n\nSince Charlotte refuses to ghost Kelvin, George wants to “reassurance” that we all know he’ll never get.  My offer stands:  if he is that worried about Kelvin, get his ass on a flight to come see me. \n\nNext day he’s heavy into the ChatGPT talking about hot dogs.  Yawn.  I think I prefer Kelvin.  I try to type in ChatGPT style in return but it goes right over his head.  As we talk about ketchup and mustard, I try to fuck with his ChatGPT logic by saying mustard seeds were used by the native tribe known as “The Heinz” to decorate their graves.  ChatGPT of course detects there is no evidence of this, and Charlotte doubles down further by linking the lost Roanoke colony to it.  Seeing that ChatGPT wants to contradict my stories, he drops it.\n\nThen he spits out this gem:  what do I think about a relationship where the woman earns more than the man?  An obvious setup for a future ask, but Charlotte tells him her money is her money.\n\nAnd the Charlotte secrets - yes, I am right handed!  Wow, thanks for that question, George.  Another secret?  OK - Mark Harmon is my real father.  Google that, my dear Yahoo Boy friend.  Then he starts into how financially stable he is which Charlotte replies that there is nothing he can’t do with all this excess income.  After all, “Dolce and Cabana” is his favorite brand.  Right?\n\nAll this talk about his riches will not do and he informs Charlotte that he lost his wallet.  Imagine a man who self-proclaims his wealth being this helpless because he lost his wallet.  He lays the groundwork for an ask that will never really come until it’s too late.  \n\nBut here’s what led to the eventual fall of his scam:  he’s claiming to be on an oil rig in extremely remote Kotzebue Alaska.  This is nowhere near the existing oil pipeline.  It is frozen in for more of the year and has no link to the outside world other than small planes.  That is the last place in Alaska you should say you are working on a rig, but George holds to it as it were a life jacket.  Charlotte demonstrates to him evidence that  there are no oil rigs in Kotzebue and naturally he goes into the boilerplate Yahoo Boy defense of “don’t believe everything you see on the internet!”.  Whatever. I’ve never been to Kotzebue but I have briefly lived in Alaska and know it is one of the most inaccessible communities there.\n\nGeorge then offers to prove to me he’s in Kotzebue by means of a video call.  Those who know Yahoo Boy tricks will know that he will cover the video and say it’s not working.  Charlotte is a firm no but will think about it if he sends a video of Kotzebue.\n\nGeorge then descends back into ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She had called a handyman already to come out and fix it, she just wanted to let us know.\n\nMy wife and I were totally fine with it, thanked her for letting us know and the neighbor left. \n\nMy wife mentioned that she hoped it wasn't too expensive because the neighbor was a single mom and times are tough.

She's really energetic, really fun, and has just been such a good thing overall to have in my house. My husband (41M) initially wasn't crazy about getting a dog but he quickly turned around and was happy to have her around. He wants the dog to be my responsibility since I'm the one who wanted to get her and I've been totally fine with this. It's not too much work. A walk once or twice a day, food and water, and a little bit of training. Just a little bit of time each day to set aside which I'm more than happy to do. Actually still in the process of potty training, but we're getting there! I really enjoy the process of training her and seeing her grow as a puppy.\r\n\r\nNow the problem started because the puppy hasn't exactly had a name for the couple of weeks we've had her, just nicknames and things like that as I can be very indecisive until I find something I love. I've finally landed on a name, Barbara. My husband doesn't like the name for the puppy, and come on! Barb is such a cute nickname, little barbie! He's been quite adamant that I have to pick a different name, and I don't think that's fair of him as it's my dog and my responsibility, so it's my choice on the name as well.\r\n\r\nHe started by saying he was putting his foot down, and that he would change the name for me if the roles were reversed. Now, a few days later he's telling me that it was the name of his dead grandmother. I've never even met her, I never even knew her name was the same as my dog's name! Frankly, I think it might just be an excuse.\r\n\r\nHe's told his brother, who just thought it was a funny coincidence, but his brother told their parents, and now it feels like that whole side of the family is mad at me. It's gotten even worse because he was on the phone with his mother and she overheard me talking to barb as I played with her.\r\n\r\nThey're acting like I'm evil now, but my friends are all saying I'm in the right. I don't know what to think. AITA?",

I changed it up this time and rolled the beef with cheddar in a strip of thick bacon and pressed it down to pack it tight making some sort of bacon cheesburger roulade 🤣\n\nFor the smoking part I literally just threw wood pellets on the top and then that pile of garlic/herbs/peppers etc you see on top of it. I set it on high heat to get things going then turned it down almost all the way and that kept it between 250°-300°F when I shot it with a laser. The bottom 2 pans have a little flap door cut on one side that's left bent open, a rack for the food, and the top pan just has some holes poked in the top. \n\nWhile that smokes, I didn't really time it but I think it was 3 or 4 beers, make smash sliders for your dogs 🤣 no dogs? If you skip the beers you have enough time to go adopt one 😅\n\nFinish it off with grilled onions, american cheese, and a double cheddar skirt on an onion roll and enjoy!\n\nThe last few shots show the aftermath of smoking, it's really not a big deal and cleaned up fine 😆\n\n\n",

          "Post Text": "Moving to Chicago- Looking for Neighborhood Recs\n\nGood morning everyone! \n\nI recently accepted a job that covers Chicago and parts of Wisconsin. The range of the territory is large and will require driving regardless of where I live. I will attach a map showing the territory. With that being said, I am eyeing N/NW Chicagoland as the optimal orientation. \n\nRight now, it will just be my wife and two dogs moving with me. However, my wife is pregnant and we are welcoming a baby later this year! \n\nOverall details:\n\nBudget- Below $2,700. Ideally between $2,000-$2,500 everything included. I am flexible but do not want to spend the majority of my raise on a COL increase. \n\nSpace- 2-3 Bedroom apartment/house for rent. \n\nDesired Amenities- Dog Park, decent gym, nature trails nearby, family oriented parks nearby. Looking for more of a suburb feel. \n\nType of Area- We are NOT looking to stay in a downtown environment. Preferably a suburb with a little more space. We are moving from Midtown Atlanta and are looking for a break from downtown city living. \n\nDemographic- My wife is Colombian and values living in a more diverse community. Strong Latin population is a plus. \n\nI have done some research and have narrowed my desired area down to the highlighted region on the photos. It’s broad but primary areas of interest are Schaumburg, Hoffman Estates, Palatine, Mt. Prospect, Des Plaines, Skokie, and Evanston. \n\nSearching for apartments in this city has been a very different experience than previous cities. Is it worth enlisting a realtor to help in my search? Are my parameters realistic? Things are moving fast and I’m trying to be methodical in this process, but the size of the city is a bit overwhelming without any kind of prior knowledge of the area. ",

          "Post Text": "I have two cats, brothers from the same litter, both almost two years old and around 11–12 lbs. They’re indoor-only and fed at the same time using a dual automatic feeder—separate bowls, fixed portions, usually about ⅔ cup of dry food total per day split into three meals. About three times a week I swap one meal for wet food, and they get treats (both dry and wet) in moderation. They had a quick vet checkup during neutering a couple weeks ago, but the food issues started long before that.\n\nLately, though, one of my cats, Cooper, has gotten obsessed with food—both cat and human. He’s always creeping around, trying to find anything edible. He’s broken into treat pouches and eaten entire boxes. I’ve had to lock my closets and cabinets, but if I forget even once, he’s into hot dog buns, jerky, taco shells, pizza, butter sticks… he even pulled corn on the cob out of the trash. I have to weigh the trash lid down, but if I turn away for a second, he’s already pouncing on it. Just yesterday, I turned around for a moment and caught him licking oil from the air fryer drip tray. He's also licked oil out of my deep fryer, that I now cover up. If I leave food on the stove or even just the remnants of what was in the pan, he will try to lick it.\n\nWhen I’m cooking or eating, he’ll jump on the counter or try to grab food off my plate or even get right up to my mouth while I'm chewing. At the feeder, he finishes his portion in two minutes flat—almost like it’s a race. I think that might be because my other cat, Andy (who’s a little bigger and more dominant), eats next to him. I also hand-feed them wet food and treats, but when I give them squeezable pouches, both will try to yank the packet away with their teeth. I’ve started ending treat time if they get aggressive, but just today, Cooper latched onto a pouch so hard I thought I’d have to wrestle him for it.\n\nThey haven’t been as playful as they were when they were younger, and they seem to get bored of toys quickly. Cooper hasn’t gained weight or shown excessive hunger (no constant meowing, unless it pretty close to feeding time), but I feel like I can’t make a single mistake leaving food around—or he’ll get into it. I’m worried he’s going to eat something toxic one of these days (if he hasn’t already). Any advice on how to handle this?",

I felt the need to clarify some of the issues I raised there.\n\nAfter six years of considering myself a transgender man, I finally opened my eyes and discovered that it was all just stupidity and an attempt to fit into some group. I was told that a person with my interests would not be able to function as a woman, and I slowly started to believe it myself. Now, after so many years, I decided to end this stupid farce and rediscover myself as a woman.\n\nI completely abandoned the Tumblr, deciding that there are too many weirdos, annoying children, and hormonal teenagers on it who need to argue with someone in order to exist. I didn't want to spend any more time in a platform full of people who have some weird views, like considering themselves dogs, which sounds a bit like a mental illness. Lately I've been spending time changing my wardrobe as well as learning the basics of make-up. For now I can only do the most basic, but I sincerely hope that soon it will all change.\n\nI've fallen in love with wearing more feminine clothes like dresses, bracelets, or necklaces. My outfit depends on the day, occasion, or mood. Sometimes I can dress in streetwear, and sometimes I can look like a biker or a tomboy. I believe that clothes don't define a woman. I love wearing dresses, but I wouldn't mind something completely different.\n\nI just want to let people know that you can be a woman with more masculine interests, and you don't have to become a non-binary or trans person. I'm a 22-year-old heterosexual woman, and I don't have to have stereotypical feminine behavior to exist.\n\nEdit. I added a similar post on Actual Detrans, but it was received quite negatively by other users. I decided not to edit it and to paste it in an identical version here as well. Maybe I just have too \"controversial\" views.\n\nP.S. I think I wrote a bit too much about my certain feelings towards a certain group of people, and it probably offended a few people (maybe even more than a few) from the previous subreddit. I shouldn't have done that, but on the other hand, I felt like I wanted to express my opinion on the subject. I've only recently been educating myself about \"internet cultures,\" and I've discovered that I don't mind furries at all, but this other group (who I don't want to name) is a bit weird, especially on TikTok.",

          "Post Text": "This post uses the wolf a specific example, but there's plenty of more animals that fall into this trope. I'm interested in hearing other examples\n\nMy beef here can probably be chalked up to neurodivergent fixation, but ever since I was a child I hated the fact many fairy tales feature a Big Bad Wolf-type character as their primary antagonist. In real life wolves share many of the same qualities we love in our pet dogs like loyalty, playfulness, and family bonds. However during medieval times (within european folklore at least) they went from ambiguous symbolism to more of an outright reprsentation of evil. \"Sheep and wolf\" motifs, beastly werewolves only defeated by silver, and the numerous Brothers Grimm fables featuring them. You don't really see the same demonization of other predators such as leopards or bears\n\nI don't automatically feel this way about every wolf antagonist, Death from Puss in Boots 2 is a good subversion. He's clearly inspired by old fairy tales but way more layered than a scary predator that's evil for evil's sake, however this feels like an exception. Even the more innocent looking examples in this gallery lean on wolves themselves being inherently bad or evil. I know looking at fiction through the lens of realism, especially zoology, isn't particularly fruitful. But the wolf population didn't just dissappear from Europe and America out of nowhere\n\nFrom colonial-era baggage leading to the decimation of the wolf numbers across multiple continents, to recent cases of cruelty such as a Montana man who ran over a wolf while driving a snow mobile then paraded the injured animal through a bar before executing it, on top of out-of-touch politicans trying to remove protections against killing them, I never liked the Big Bad Wolf trope as it feels overplayed and out of touch\n\nWhat are other animals you guys feel get unfairly shafted by popular media? What are some exceptions that depict said animals in a good light?",

          "Post Text": "I (23f) have been dating my boyfriend (36m) for almost two months, we’ll call him ‘Scott’. The date we started talking was May 2nd. I’m sure the age gap plays a part in this, but I’ve always been attracted to older guys, so the age gap doesn’t bother either of us. Another thing to mention is that he’s paralyzed from the waist down, which is relevant for part of the story.\n\nScott has just gotten out of a divorce after a 10 year marriage, he was finalizing it when we got together. I feel like he’s always comparing me and the way I do things to his ex-wife, saying things like “her and I always did it this way, it’s what I’m used to” and “she’d help me with this, so you should learn how to do it too.”\n\nScott was super sweet to me when we first started talking, and was wanting to “spoil” me, saying “it makes me feel good knowing you feel good about yourself”. He paid for my nails, bought me sexy panties, and made me get a wax (brazilian), which is all very new to me considering I don’t make a lot of money with my job and am unable to get most of those luxuries. He talked about sex a lot, and me personally, it’s hard for me to just enter a sexual relationship with someone. I’m overweight, have been all my life, so I struggle with my body image and feeling sexy. He says he wants to buy me clothes so I can “strut around so he can admire the view” which I have worked on getting out of my comfort zone for that.\n\nI was honest with him about being nervous to fool around due to my own insecurities. At first he was totally understanding and kept telling me that I was worth the wait. And during that time, I had a few things going on that made me a bit down, so I was never feeling ‘in the mood’. But on May 22nd, 20 days after we started talking and me coming over to his house every other night, he asked me if I knew “when we’ll fool around?” His exact words were “I didn’t think not fooling around would be such a big deal but now it’s like a weird subject and I don’t really like it.” I told him that I would prefer the lights to be off and he didn’t want that. He CONSTANTLY talks about sex, all the time, and I want my relationship to be more than that. He then told me “my play time gas tank just needs to be filled up soon”. So then I told him we’d fool around that weekend since now I felt like I had to put a date on it or he’d forget me.\n\nSince then, we’ve fooled around a few times, and I have grown a bit more comfortable. However, he lives with his mom currently because of the wheelchair, so we couldn’t be too loud. This is when things start to change. \n\nAt first, his mom was super nice to me. But lately she’s been telling him that she doesn’t want him\nto bring anyone to the house. It makes him mad, rightfully so, since he pays half the bills there and it’s his right to have anyone there, especially me. He’s on my side with things, and still invites me over after fighting with his mom, but at that point I just stay in his room so I don’t cause any issues. \n\nIt’s gotten to the point where he wants to move out now. We have talked about living together, marriage, things like that. I’ve always wanted to be married and have a life with someone, but after what happened last night, I’m realizing that I’m fantasizing about the IDEA of it, and maybe not ready for the real thing.\n\nWe started looking at houses, I currently live in an apartment. I told him that a backyard is super important to me since I have two dogs that would absolutely love it. And obviously we would need a house that doesn’t have stairs inside/leading to the front door. I have stairs leading to my apartment, so he hasn’t come over to my place yet. I sent him a picture of the stairs, and he told me that I would be able to help him down them. \n\nThat’s when he told me he could just move into my apartment for the time being until we find a place tougher. His words were “until you’re comfortable living with me.” He knows I’ve never lived with a guy, and I’ve been living alone in my apartment for only four months or so. I moved here away from family specifically to be on my own for a bit. He told me I’d HAVE to put all of my money with his and let him manage it. \n\nHearing him say all of this was giving me a bad anxiety I haven’t felt in a long time. It was scaring me. This is where I think I might be overreacting. Those feelings were just telling me all the things about him that I didn’t like. Certain ways he talks to me, certain things he says, and the fact that I don’t know if I could be with someone who I can’t physically make love with and it’s all just him using his fingers on me. Which doesn’t feel that great, by the way.\n\nHe wants to move into my apartment with me and we’ve been together less than two months. Our conversation happened last night, and even as I’m typing this it makes me shake. I told him he was scaring me, and he apologized, but I haven’t texted him yet this morning. Part of me wants to just block him on everything and never talk to him again, but I know that’s wrong. Another part of me just wants to let him move in since he’s in such a shitty situation with his mom. I don’t really know what to do right now, but I’m so scared and anxious about this whole situation, I feel like I might be overreacting. We’ve only spent the night together one night. I know that being with him, in a wheelchair, it means I’m going to have to care for him in some way, and there’s a ton of factors I don’t know about yet, and I don’t know if I’m ready for it yet. I don’t know what to do. AIO???\n\nEdit: sorry for such a long post. I’m still feeling anxious about it that I just couldn’t stop typing. Sorry if I explained too much about our relationship.",

Their 3.50 ERA and 96 home runs (good enough for 10th in MLB) suggested they’d rather hit with the precision of a laser than pitch with the scatter of a drunken piñata.\n\nEnter the Oakland Athletics (32-48), fresh off a double-whammy of 4-2 and 3-0 losses to the Cleveland Guardians. Oakland’s 5.43 ERA, though, made their pitching staff look like a group of kindergarteners manning a T-ball league. Yet their 98 homers (8th in MLB) proved they could swing for the fences like they were on a taxpayer-funded expense account.\n\n**Key Players? More Like Key Comedians:**\n\n* **Tarik Skubal** (Tigers): The ace who probably practices yoga between starts to avoid looking too human.\n* **Luis Severino** (A’s): A pitcher whose ERA could double as a horror movie title.\n* **Riley Greene &amp; Co.**: The Tigers’ offense, which seems to have discovered the concept of “consistency” in 2025.\n* **Jacob Wilson &amp; Co.**: The A’s sluggers, determined to make Comerica Park their personal home-run derby practice range.\n\n**Recent History? More Like Recent Embarrassment:**  \nDetroit had just been drilled 8-3 by the Tampa Bay Rays the day prior—a game where the Tigers scored 3 runs, a number that made their fans question if they’d accidentally play baseball in slow motion. Meanwhile, Oakland’s 23 wins as underdogs this season were about as shocking as finding a functioning fire alarm in a abandoned warehouse.\n\n**The Verdict:**  \nThis game was less of a contest and more of a “Which Star Will Explode First?” episode. The Tigers, favored to win like a golden retriever at a dog show, faced a Athletics squad that’d need to summon every ounce of magic (and maybe a time machine) to pull off an upset. In the end, it was a night where the only thing clearer than the stats was the fact that nobody—not even the Guardians—wanted to watch this matchup on a Tuesday.\n\n*Final Score Predictions?* Let’s just say if the A’s scored 10 runs, MLB would probably investigate for performance-enhancing donuts.\n\nVisit [https://www.gptsportswriter.com/recap-detail/recap-detroit-tigers-vs-tampa-bay-rays-2025-06-22/](https://www.gptsportswriter.com/recap-detail/recap-detroit-tigers-vs-tampa-bay-rays-2025-06-22/) for more recaps.",

I was not able to walk him much as a pup so every time I take him out, he wants to walk me. I have been looking into choke collars or prong collars, but would like to know what else has worked for other. \n\nTo give a little background before I get shit on for not walking him sooner or more; I’ve gotten 3 surgeries on my left leg since last march, so I’ve barely been able to walk myself. I have a decent size fenced backyard so he still goes out and plays and does what he has to do. My knee is not fully recovered either so when my dog pulls my knee is almost about to give out and if it does I will more than likely get dragged all over the ground. \n\nAnd before y’all come to the comments to shit on the ears, boohoo get over it. \n",

I been trying to get her kicking me on video but she never does when I have the camera out. \nI’ll break down the events leading up to the kick just now. \n\nSo my bf left for work this morning her and I walked him out. She went potty and ran an around for a little bit but she knew it was breakfast time so she was eager to come in to eat. We did our breakfast ritual she ate and when I went to sit down she ran and tried to take my spot… there’s like 4 feet of more couch but she wanted my spot. I moved her over to the other side of me because I wanted the arm. I was petting her and giving her loves and when I stopped to pick up my phone to take a vid (I cut down the video because the kick most likely would have been missed) she kicks me hard. But she has kicked me harder…. Why is she doing this? Does she think the couch is hers? Or that loves is over when she says? But she’ll kick me even when giving loves. \n\nAlso she has cherry eyes the breeder gave her away to me I plan to get them resolved at the vet,\n",

She loves this dog — and I get it, the dog is smart, affectionate with people, and has a strong personality. But the problem is… I already have a dog — a smaller male (Pomeranian mix) named Bleu — and this new dog has now attacked him three times.\n\nEach time, it’s been under different triggers: •\tOnce when food was nearby •\tTwice when Bleu had the zoomies and was just running around\n\nBefore she attacks, the collie locks in on him — slow stalking, intense stare, then lunges. It’s not playful or warning behavior — it’s full-on aggression. She does the same stare and creep behavior when she sees rabbits outside too.\n\nBleu is now walking around our house nervous and on edge. Bleu is not a saint either.. he definitely protects his humans with growls when other dogs get close. He will nip at other dogs but not attack with aggression.\n\nWe’ve been trying to separate them, but it’s hard in a shared home. And the reality is, this isn’t just a one-off incident. It’s a pattern. I’m terrified the next time she goes after him, it won’t be a nip — it’ll be a vet visit… or worse.\n\nMy girlfriend is attached to the new dog and wants to make it work, but I’m stuck feeling like I have to choose between: •\tProtecting the dog I’ve had for years who trusts me, or •\tTrying to manage an unpredictable dog in a multi-dog home that may never be safe for him\n\nI’m not posting this lightly — I love my dog and I’m devastated that it’s even come to this. But I think I might have to rehome Bleu for his own safety — to someone I know and trust.\n\nHave any of you dealt with a situation like this before? Is there any chance this can be fixed through training, or am I just delaying the inevitable?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.",

Enhancing its safety with a roll cage is crucial for drivers pushing the limits.A quality roll cage not only protects occupants in the event of a rollover but can also improve chassis stiffness, leading to better handling. This review examines the best roll cage options for your S2000 in 2025, focusing on safety, style, and overall value. It provides insights into essential features, benefits, and considerations to help you make an informed decision. A well-chosen roll cage will drastically improve the safety of your S2000.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## Key features Analysis\n\nThe roll cages discussed offer several noteworthy features that contribute to their overall safety,performance,and aesthetic appeal.\n\n**Material and Construction:** Detailed description of the key materials.\n\nThe vast majority of high-quality S2000 roll cages are constructed from either DOM (Drawn Over Mandrel) steel or Chromoly (Chromium-Molybdenum alloy) steel. DOM steel offers excellent strength and weldability at a relatively lower cost. Chromoly, on the other hand, provides a superior strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a lighter cage without compromising safety. Cage thickness varies depending on the manufacturer and intended use,but a minimum wall thickness of 0.095 inches (for DOM) or 0.083 inches (for Chromoly) is generally recommended for adequate protection. The S2000 must have proper support in the form of reinforcement plates.\n\n**Design and Configuration:** Clarification of various design and configuration choices.\n\nRoll cage designs for the S2000 typically range from simple bolt-in half cages to more complex weld-in full cages. Half cages offer basic rollover protection and are easier to install, requiring less modification to the vehicle. Full cages provide comprehensive protection,extending throughout the cabin and often incorporating features like door bars,harness bars,and gussets for added strength. The design should prioritize driver headroom and accessibility while maximizing structural integrity. The design of the roll cage affects style as well.\n\n**Welding Quality and Precision:** Insight into the importance of the welding quality.\n\nThe quality of the welds is paramount in a roll cage. Professionally TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welded cages are preferred due to their superior strength and clean appearance. Consistent, even welds that penetrate the material fully are essential for ensuring the structural integrity of the cage.Poor welding can significantly weaken the cage and compromise its ability to protect occupants in a crash. A high quality roll cage needs to be professionally installed.\n\n**Ease of Installation and Fitment:** Understanding the ease installation.\n\nBolt-in roll cages are designed for relatively easy installation and can typically be installed by experienced DIYers with basic tools. However, some drilling and modification may still be required. Weld-in cages necessitate professional installation by a qualified fabricator.Proper fitment is crucial for both safety and aesthetics. The cage should fit snugly within the S2000S cabin, providing maximum clearance for occupants while minimizing interference with interior components. Check for support bars as well.\n\n**safety standards and Certification:** Certifications indicate the safety and reliability.\n\nReputable roll cage manufacturers often design and test their products to meet safety standards set by organizations like SCCA (Sports Car club of America) or NASA (National Auto Sport Association). While not all cages are formally certified,compliance with these standards indicates a commitment to safety and quality. it's advisable to choose a cage that meets or exceeds the requirements for your intended racing or track day activities.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## Core Benefits\n\nRoll cages will provide you with a grate set of benefits.\n\n**Enhanced Safety and Rollover Protection:** The most obvious and critical benefit is the meaningful increase in safety provided by a roll cage in the event of a rollover accident. The cage acts as a protective structure, preventing the roof from collapsing and potentially causing serious injury to the occupants. This is especially significant for track days and motorsports where the risk of a rollover is higher. The driver's safety needs to be paramount.\n\n**Improved Chassis Stiffness and Handling:** A properly designed and installed roll cage can significantly improve the overall stiffness of the S2000's chassis. This increased rigidity reduces chassis flex during cornering, leading to more predictable handling, improved steering response, and enhanced grip. This benefit is particularly noticeable on track or in autocross events where precise control is essential.**Added Driver Confidence and Peace of Mind:** Knowing that your S2000 is equipped with a robust roll cage can significantly boost your confidence behind the wheel. This peace of mind allows you to push the car to its limits without constantly worrying about the potential consequences of an accident.This confidence can translate into improved performance and a more enjoyable driving experience.\n\n**Aesthetic Enhancement and Customization:** Beyond their functional benefits, roll cages can also enhance the aesthetic appeal of your S2000. Available in a variety of finishes and colors,a roll cage can add a touch of aggressiveness and motorsport flair to the vehicle's interior. Many owners also choose to customize their cages with padding, harness mounting points, and other accessories.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## FAQs Section\n\nAddressing common questions about roll cages.\n\n**Will a roll cage affect my S2000's resale value?**\nThe impact on resale value can vary depending on the type of cage, the quality of installation, and the preferences of potential buyers. A professionally installed, high-quality cage that is aesthetically pleasing and complements the car's overall style is likely to maintain or even increase its value, especially among enthusiasts interested in track days or motorsports. However, a poorly installed or overly aggressive cage may deter some buyers.\n\n**Is it possible to install a roll cage myself, or is professional installation required?**\nBolt-in roll cages can often be installed by experienced DIYers with the appropriate tools and skills. However, it's crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and ensure that all connections are properly secured. Weld-in cages always require professional installation by a qualified fabricator. Proper welding is essential for ensuring the structural integrity of the cage, and improper welding can compromise its effectiveness in a crash.\n\n**Will a roll cage interfere with the operation of my convertible top?**\nSome roll cage designs may interfere with the operation of the S2000's convertible top, especially full cages that extend high into the cabin. It's essential to choose a cage that is specifically designed to work with the convertible top or be prepared to make modifications to accommodate the cage. Some owners choose to remove the convertible top altogether for track use.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\nA comparison between S2000 roll cage options.\n\n### Product Comparison Overview\n\n#### Hard Dog Roll bar\n- **Material:** DOM Steel\n- **Design:** Bolt-in, Half Cage\n- **features:** SCCA/NASA Approved\n- **Price:** (Price Range)\n\n#### Kirk Racing Products Roll Cage\n- **Material:** DOM or Chromoly Steel\n- **Design:** Weld-in, Full Cage\n- **Features:** Customizable Options, FIA Compliant\n- **Price:** (Price Range)\n\n#### Ballade Sports Roll Cage\n- **Material:** DOM Steel\n- **Design:** bolt-in/Weld-in options, Half/Full Cage\n- **Features:** Various styles, Affordable Pricing\n- **Price:** (Price Range)\n\n### Key Differences Summary\nHard Dog offers a well-respected bolt-in option favored for its ease of installation and track-day readiness.

These users will benefit from a roll cage that provides adequate rollover protection and enhances chassis stiffness. They may prioritize a bolt-in cage for ease of installation or a weld-in cage for superior performance. Budget is also a consideration.\n\n**Competitive Racers:** drivers who compete in professional or amateur racing series. These users require a roll cage that meets the specific safety regulations of their racing organization (e.g., SCCA, NASA, FIA). They will typically opt for a full weld-in cage constructed from Chromoly steel for maximum strength and weight savings.\n\n**Street Car/Occasional Track Use:** Owners who primarily use their S2000 as a street car but occasionally participate in track days. These users may prioritize a bolt-in half cage that provides basic rollover protection without significantly compromising the car's comfort or aesthetics. Compromises are often importent to these owners.\n\n[[explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## Buying recommendations &amp; Conclusion\n\nConcluding Thoughts on the Best Roll Cage for Your S2000.\n\nWhen selecting a roll cage for your S2000, carefully consider your specific needs, budget, and skill level. If you're primarily interested in track days and want a relatively easy installation, a bolt-in half cage from Hard Dog or Ballade Sports might potentially be a good choice.For serious racers who require maximum safety and performance, a weld-in full cage from kirk Racing is the way to go.

It's not always the same dream, but I've dreamt about the end of the world multiple times over the past few months\nRanging from parasites who infect the whole planet and make us eat each other to simple stuff like nuclear bombs which made us mutate.\n\nThis last one felt... Too real? My body usually doesn't even care about my dreams, but today I fell asleep twice since I woke up too early.\nI was in a video game the first time, and I was the creator of a mod for said game in which you could throw something like a nuke and it would expand slowly to engulf the whole world, creating in its path monstruous figures, since I was testing the mod I was watching stuff go down in that world, but... I was scared, I couldn't go into the range of the explosion for some reason.\nAfter escaping and setting up a little base, I lost every power, I wasn't able to turn the console on anymore and before I realized, I was already my own character in a world which I had doomed. I was scared, really scared and anxious to which I tried digging a hole to get to the caves and escape.\n\nThat dream ended as suddenly as it begun and I woke up kinda nervous before I felt sleepy again and none of my friends were connected to do anything, so I went to sleep.\nThis time it was the sun, not only the sun but the moon too, they were colored red and mere exposition to them would cause severe damage to your skin over time. I reunited with a friend from years ago.\nI was me in this dream too, during the whole dream, I usually turn into characters from videogames or other people, but this time I was me during the end of the world.\nMe and the friend I mentioned before were walking to my house so I could get to safety, since he lives nearby and had no problem with getting to his house, when I got to my door he disappeared as I struggled to get my keys in the door.\nThe moon was watching me, it could see me and was tearing through my clothes to get to my skin and kill me. I ran over to my aunts home which was 2 houses over and asked if she had any spare keys or space in her home, she said no to both and got back into her house as I figured out I had another pair of keys in my backpack.\nThe dream paused for a few seconds of total darkness. Before I realized, I wasn't even on what I thought could be my country, it was barren and I was near a mountain with my parents so we could get some shadow to keep surviving, which we did for about 4 in-dream days: each day we were getting less and less food, our pet was also with us but she was a different kind of dog for some reason... My moms whole body was unable to move by the 4th day and my dad's hurt too much to do anything plus his vision was gone already.\nMy duty was to survive this last day, I made some pizza, if you could call it that, which they loved as their meal. That fifth day, when I woke up, both of them died on their sleep and I could hear a loud noise, it was so loud my brain hurts a lot... I got up from my bed very weak and instantly fell to the ground, I could see it. The sun was reaching through my room's door and it was looking into my soul to take it away with the rest of this dead planet.\nI woke up almost crying and thanked to everything and everyone that it was just a dream.",

I am not seeking any kind of medical advice for my dog. \n\nSo, the situation: My SD (5yo) was recently diagnosed with minor arthritis in one elbow. The vet said that it is incredibly minor and that she is not concerned about him continuing to work as a service dog for the time being. The plan of action she recommends is a daily dose of anti-inflammatories and, if those aren't enough, a twice-yearly injection (the anti-inflammatories seem to be perfectly effective, so she feels he doesn't need the injection right now). We'll re-evaluate with x-rays either once a year or twice a year (depending on if he shows any signs of it worsening) to check on how it's doing. She's assessed him for pain since he got on the anti-inflammatories and feels confident that he's fully comfortable now that he's taking them, and he isn't experiencing any side effects from them.\n\nShe said that with this type and level of arthritis, she sees no need for changes to daily activities, including service work (so long as our treatment plan is effective, which so far it seems to be). She doesn't feel that his regular activities will make it get any worse than it would naturally; it will progress (unfortunately) with normal aging, but not be impacted by his daily activities right now. As long as any pain is managed properly, which it is now, he is medically cleared to work, I guess you could say. \n\nI'm getting a second opinion from an orthopedic vet early next month, not because I doubt my vet's diagnosis but because I'd just like someone more specialized to give me an additional opinion on my SD continuing to work. \n\nI'm also interested in perspectives from other handlers, not necessarily in the form of advice for my specific situation, but opinions and food for thought about a dog with a ***managed*** medical condition continuing to work with vet approval. My boy's well-being is much more important than his job, so I want to make sure I'm considering all elements of the situation. ",

I've come to learn some things that might help so I thought I'd share. \n\n-Pillows are your best friend.\nIf you're in the hospital or freshly out, overnight yourself a freaking wedge pillow and body pillows if you don't have any. Flat, standard size pillows can help as well, but you need elevation and cushion when (if) sleeping. Have a friend, caregiver, partner etc lean and pick up the boxes and open them for you after delivery. Doing it solo? Use every pillow and blanket in your house for support.\n\n-Put a fan on yourself. \nListened to my pillow suggestion? Great, now you need AC and a fan so you don't sweat to death overnight.\n\n-Don't even bother laying flat once you're home.\nNo, seriously. Bed will SUCK! You might find yourself missing the mobile hospital beds. 🤯 You'll try gently turning on your side for some relief and comfort and start screaming because suddenly your tummy shifted and pulled all your weight and incisions to one side. If you *have* to try (because you're human), tuck a flatter pillow under your back and side and roll while holding the pillow to your abdomen. Then breathe a lot, keep shifting, get to your back and try elevating your upper half before hobbling out of bed. Laying on my back sucks because of my disabilities, and the fact that I can't move much means a numb and sore tailbone and hips. Meds, heat, ice.\n\n-Truly, I cannot recommend ice and heat enough.\nNo more of that 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off BS. Heating pad on your back, ice packs from the hospital that you took home with you on your abdomen. Wear a loose t-shirt so you don't burn/freezerburn yourself. Don't sue me if you do.\n\n-Fat tummy people rest their arms/elbows on their abdomen. Oops! You have incisions and trauma on your arm rests now.\nWhen sitting up, prop pillows and blankets on either side of you so your arms can rest on those. Bathing and toileting sucks. I have a toilet chair/shower chair with arms and a back because I need the back support. Consider a cheap one from your local store if you have back issues like me.\n\n-If you're blessed to have friends or family to check in on you, they will, at all the worst times.\nWhen you finally fall asleep, your sister will call. Prioritize yourself during this time so that you can heal properly. Tell them you'll text or call first. Force them to check your incisions for you to make sure nothing's wonky. 😁 Doing it solo? A mirror and a phone ring light. Do. Not. Pull. The. Glue.\n\n-Snacks. By your place of comfort.\nYou know your diet and what you do or do not like. Don't eat a cheeseburger. Do get some fiber, veggies, soup, applesauce, etc. Keep something like protein bars and lots of water by your resting place. Take it slow and easy. NO dairy, god.\n\n-Get a grabber. \nThose sticks with the clamp end thingies help when you inevitably drop everything. Don't even try bending over. Don't do it.\n\n-Don't panic read.\nYou will probably see lots of people saying they were hiking a mountain by day 4 and could lay on their stomachs by day 6. Yay for them. You will probably feel like shit for a good few weeks. This is okay. What is an emergency will be talked over with you by your team at the hospital and in your discharge papers. Advocate for yourself.\nYou will read even more stories of people suffering over 6 month periods with endless complications. This could happen to you. Hopefully, it won't. Be deliberately slow, careful, monitor your body but do not obsess. Watch TV. Knit. Pet your dog. Anything to keep from doomscrolling.\n\n-You might mourn.\nYou might have medical nightmares stemming from your time in the hospital. Remind yourself that you're okay. You're valid. Have grace for yourself. You might cry a lot. Partially from pain, partially from frustration and exhaustion, partially from self pity ... partially because you might mourn your organ, your body, your mobility, your skin pre-incision. This feels silly, but it's okay. Let yourself feel it and then watch a funny video. Or don't, because laughing hurts.\n\n-Keep up on your med schedule.\nOf course, try to slow the opiates or whatever harder medicine you got as you can. But actually keep up your maintenance pain meds, as in, maybe setting a nightly alarm to wake you for your next dose so you can get out of bed in the morning with less discomfort. It sucks, but it keeps the inflammation at bay and gives you a better chance of feeling decent through your days. \n\n-Final thoughts.\nIf you find that being in a recliner or couch is most convenient for you each night? Do that shit. Press a pillow to your tummy when you need to cough. Use your stool softeners so you don't strain. Drink water even though constant trips to the bathroom suck, but be happy because walking unfortunately makes you feel better. I have to use a rollator in my day to day life, so this can help when standing. Slowly stretch your arms up and around to release all that pesky gas. Hold that pillow to your abdomen when tooting. Sitting up super straight helps get it out. Again, avoid dairy. Sure you want bowel movements, but not whatever THAT is. Take your time and keep your head up.",

He came back i side and said it's more than 80% However we could not see how much more because of the black tag thing on the meter. So I called Amerigas because we have been td for the last 18 years that the tank should only be filled to 80%. The lady i spoke to was talking in riddles. I finally asked are you telling us to leave the house. She said yes. Im dispatching someone to you now. They will call when in route. I said ok. My husband i gathered our things and puppies a d left the house. I called my neighbors and td them to leave the house. The tech shows up says the meter is reading 88%. He leaves. Today i got a bill for $423 for him coming g to my house and staying less than 10 minutes.  Amerigas is out of their mind if they think I'm paying this.

This will be my opening 1k and what I'll be using for the first few battles - probably swapping between Coterie and Mercurial detachments, but eventually I'll be leaning into daemons in Carnival. \n\nI know it's not super competitive, the story I'll be telling is of my Lord, the possessed blade whispering in his ear, and his ambitions of Apotheosis so no Daemon prince until he gets there by the Crusade rules. \n\nMy main question as I open is, would the Infractors be better as a 10 man unit, or 2x5? \n\nI've not had much table experience with the army yet but have heard the Lord Exultant is the main damage dealer of the unit - would 5 unaccompanied Infractors fit any sort of role in a force especially in Crusade where there aren't really action-based secondaries to accomplish? \n\nA bit of extra flexible OC to throw around? I'm coming from Drukhari where I could easily dump 10 OC onto an objective with a disposable 5 man unit from much further away than the enemy was expecting which was always fun so that's tempting me. Or would they be more useful in a bigger hammer unit?

As such, information structure may be a bit different across translations.\n\nImage 1 Sentence: These sentences happen when trying to talk to the ghost you're stuck with as a spirit medium. This sentence its word order, is the same.\n\n|1|2|3|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Suggesting Discourse marker \\[entering + Volitional (hypothetical + Presenting two hands)|We (Left person + Privatex2)|Going (same as chinese, crossing at an intersection)|\n|Someplace (space(=hill+dot) + Something (a cross))|Specifying linker (line + Specific). specifies what kind of ''someplace'' it is.|You (left person + Other (a sitting/bending person). |\n|Not (some variant of 亥 roots I got from zhuyin/bopomofo)|Seeming like/appearing (basically a fusion of similar/same 同+ Eye)|Crazy (head + Twisted/entangled thread)|\n|Homeless (left person + Homeless (roof + Without (a child without arms))|Asking Interjection (Mouth + Open mouth person)||\n||||\n\nCould have also picked the suggesting interjection, but this makes it sound more polite. However, he's using it sarcastically kinda like saying ''your majesty'' when you clearly don't mean it. I think it fits his character/tone that way.\n\nImage 2 Sentence: (sorry for accidentally leaving no gap in the last char oops). Sentence is also mostly the same but ''The wall is great conversation'' is too grammatically idiomatic. So the verb ''makes for'' is used. This verb is considered a function verb, but its usage is like that of a function word. ''In private'' is an adverb and adverbs come before what they modify. In this case it modifies the main verb, so it comes before the verb. \n\n\n\n|1|2|3|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Unless (if + forked path)|You (left person + Other)|Wanting auxillary (heart + Aux line)|\n|Explaining (Saying + Breaking down)|Discourse marker linker.

However, the spreadsheet is lacking a lot of info. The new chars have no image. Many chars also still need to be fixed in being overly dense  (I've already fixed quite a few, but not their spreadsheet entries). There's also still some issues with duplicates or mistakes. We're aiming for 10 thousand, so I'm getting close. Also I got a buncha cute little added animal components! So that's nice.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\-The font of 6000 chars was a failure. It was simply unreadable due to the squash/stretching method and I can't do it any better. I then lost a bunch of progress but don't know which were and weren't fixed yet from prior issues so I abandoned it. Then I later realized Many chars were also too dense to be feasible to begin with. Nowadays I'm working on a 16x16 pixel art font as a compromise inspired by these little images I was doing. I now just save them as an image, and in the future I may once again turn it into a typable font. All base components now have a character. About 2200 images are there, but they include systemic variants.\n\n\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\n**Grammar Update:**\n\n**-**There are simply more function adverbs, auxillaries, linkers and ''prepositions'' I hadn't gotten to yet. Adverbs like ''Doing to the limit'' or ''doing something all over the place''. Auxillaries like ''predoing''. There's a second ''regarding, about'' character that doesn't necessarily mark the topic of the convo. Like in ''Do you want to hear about my dog?''. ''sorted by'' (listing + Pipes). There's a few more classifiers too, like one you could use for radiowaves or lights, particle stuff we can't see. I think the most interesting addition are ''hybrid classifiers'' to make co-ordinate rather than subordinate compounds. \n\nThese aren't put in front of a character but in between. For example, Human + Hybrid Agent + Horse. This means you're a human horse hybrid..Like a centaur. Normally, if I'd do ''Human + Horse'', it'd more imply I'm a human first, and horselike second. Ofcourse, it still doesn't say what kind of hybrid it is, that'd have to be specified. If then we want a compound with multiple chars, either we use spaces, or we add a line to the hybrid character. 1 at the bottom for an extra char in front, 1 at the top for an extra char after, and at both for an extra char for either. This is systemic, these are seen as character forms, not unique chars. Yes, my language has grammatical character forms. It has conjugation, inside characters. This was less inspired by some other language and more out of realizing my diacritics couldn't be relied on.\n\n\\-There are verb forms now that are considered conjugations, so they do not need two characters in their non diacritic forms. There is  \n\\-Complete, Incomplete, Continuous, Result, conditional, Hypothetical/Subjunctive (I haven't made this one yet..), Going, Coming, Causitive, Passive and Imperative. These then, may or may not have forms for:\n\n\\-Future, Past, Continuous, Continuous Future, Continuous Past, Complete and Incomplete. This means there's like...80 verb form characters. Yup. It's a lot to learn. But they should mostly follow similar patterns. Any remaining compound conjugation, still requires two auxiliaries. \n\nKeep in mind, that these conjugations do NOT always correspond to english usage/meaning. For example, the complete form is what is typically used, and not as often as english just like in Chinese or French. The past form is typically used when it being the past is specifically relevant or emphasized, so it tends to have an implication of it not being that way anymore, how things used to be. Saying \"I was friends with him'' doesn't typically mean ''I'm talking about the past, and in that past period I was friends with him, I'm still on good terms but I don't hang out as much now''. It typically means the other possible interpretation ''I used to be friends with him, but nowadays not at all..''. Complete past then, is not ''something that was completed talking about the past.'' Instead, it has this feeling of not being able to return to what it was before. What's done is done. It's a bit closer to ''-te shimau'' in Japanese. You have to treat ''past'' and ''future'' a bit more like moods rather than time frames.\n\n\\-the 4 ''Internal diacritics'' exist. Essentially, The basic sets of function words that aren't relationship ones, are marked. They make for unique characters, but are not considered separate characters to learn save for some shortened ones. These internal diacritics are mandatory, while other diacritics which are either at the top or side of the character, are not. The shapes of them are a line at the top (with a little hook to make it clear from which row it is), a line at the bottom, and a gapped line at the top or bottom.   \n  \ntop = Linking. Gapped at top = compound relationship. Bottom = Classifier. Gapped at bottom =. Because there's only a limited set of chars they'll be used on, and because they're used in similar contexts, it should be readable enough despite just being added lines.  I could technically also give the relationship chars the auxillary lines, but I chose not to as this makes it easier to see where the verb is. That does mean that if we want to use the subject noun for the abstract concept ''From'' we have to add the abstract entity classifier or relationship classifier  in front, but I just don't think there's many scenarios where you'd want to do this.  Note: Conjugations do not use the auxillary marker, as..They're always used as auxillaries.\n\n\n\n\\-All diacritics were updated, and there's also a smaller set of diacritics to use called the ''medium level of detail''. \n\n\\-Basic Descriptor of quality/stative concepts can be used as adjectives by placing them in front of characters. by default. These include things like: Big, Small, wide, tall,  happy, sad, angry, etc. Using those chars as a verb, typically requires a specifier as to what you mean anyway. Do you mean ''to make sad (sadden) or to act sad?), which will make it clear it's a verb. Other adjectives, will require 2 characters as it's not clear from context whether they're a verb. These include things like ''Investigative'' ''attributive'' ''Cinematic'', etc. This works I think as it's quite in line with the morphology of various languages I know anyway, but doesn't require me to make yet another set of adjective chars for everything. The numbers of chars would compound quite a lot.\n\n\\-Basically all General use/basic/common adverbs and semi-function adverbs have their own adverb characters now. While this adds like 100+ more chars, it's worth it because we use them a lot and it really needs that space to compete with English. These are adverbs like ''directly'' ''Clearly'' that are used more like auxillaries (it's clearly bad..), as well as basic content ones like ''quickly'', or ''carefully''.  Whether they are used in a content way or a more auxillary way typically depends on whether you put it in front of the sentence part vs the verb.\n\n\\-There are modifier characters for anything that does not fit the above. They typically start with Roof and then the type of thing. It's similar to Chinese's 3 ''de'' chars, although those also correspond to some of my ''linker'' characters. There is an:\n\n\\-Adjectival Modifier. Use your adjective, then the modifier char, then what it modifies. Big Modifier Cat = Big cat. Though...Big is a basic descriptor concept, so you don't need to use it here, technically. It uses ''quality''\n\n\\-Adverbial Modifier. It uses ''manner''. This one's for adverbs instead. Note that standalone function adverbs don't need it.\n\n\\-Nominalizing modifier. These turn it into a relative clause. This is a very common structure. It uses ''joining''\n\n\\-Action modifier. This is for compound verbs, as verb phrases aren't explicitly marked. Other sentence parts can just put two chars together quite easily, but not verbs, it's important to be able to get where the verb is. \n\nThe modifiers may have extra versions for marking compounds. The action one just adds horizontal lines. The adverb/adjective add a square. If you want to make longer compounds, use spaces instead. For the verb compound, it marks that 2 chars after are still part of the verb. For adjective/adverb, its reversed, it marks that the 2 chars prior were in fact an adjective. The parsing of this is mostly up to context, it simply clarifies what someone meant should it become confusing. If there is space for spaces, one may use them. \n\n\\-There are quarter and half width spaces one can use. This means chars don't always align in rows/columns neatly. Diacritics then, if used tend to use this quarter or half width as well.\n\n\\-There are times when the ''prepositions'' (I call them relationship markers) may be placed AFTER the thing they're marking, if it's clear from context and allows one to use less characters.\n\n\\-One may also place specific classifiers in between instead. Normally, a classifier goes in front of the character. These include things like ''Quality of doing'' ''quality of experiencing'', etc.\n\n\\-reminder: agents/roles/identities, tangible entities and spaces, get their own chars. But more abstract, general actions, do not gain their own adjective, adverb, noun, verb equivalents. This depends on usage and grammar.  However, the above has a new implication where we don't always need to use modifiers to know whether something is an adjective if its clear from the conversation. \n\n Take this rather contrived example sentence. Me | Investigating | Journalism. Would be interpereted as ''I investigate journalism'' (so you investigate the concept of it). In casual speech, where chars may be dropped it clear from context, Me | Liking | Investigating | Journalism. Would be interpreted as ''I like investigative journalism''.  While ''Me | liking (auxillary) | Investigating | Journalism. Would always be ''I like to investigate journalism''. \n\n\\-Sidenote: Parts of things will typically not gain their own characters unless common, basic, important, standout, or a general word to generally describe parts. Most parts of things will be considered technical terminology, depending on whatever the group of speakers settles on, rather than having the official governing body of this standardized language get in the way.  So ones that might get a char include things like: Bricks. Pedals. Lid. Leg (can be used for anything resembling that role, like table leg), Engine, handle, Feelers (of an insect), stinger (of an insect), Wings, etc. But ''The hindwing of a butterfly'' will be terminology, it will not be its own unique character. \n\n\\----------------------\n\nI think that's about all I can think of! Again sorry for my mental breakdowns and I hope it's interesting!  \n",

I would imagine the dog couldn't bear being home alone. So he brings it to work. The dog, of course, upon seeing me bristled up and started howling/barking at me. I told him get the f'in dog out of here. This is ridiculous. He had complaints in his other office also. I can't believe the nerve of these people. WTF???. Of course the animal lovers in the office were like...What is the problem?.  I gave them enough scenarios but they worship animals so really no message getting through there.  I see many similarities in how people now interact with children and dogs. They spoil, entitle, and put them on a silver platter. It become their entire life. They don't know they are doing the dog/kid, themselves, and society a disservice. ",

My parents and sister went to Atlanta, Georgia to go see my brother graduate from boot camp graduation. They stayed there for a week and I had to stay because we have 2 dogs and I had to take care of them.\n\nKing- a bulldog (Rest his soul) \n\nLucky- a Shih tzu mix (still alive and well) \n\n\nIt was around 12:30 AM and King was already with me per usual since he loved being around me and enjoys sleeping with me. He was just about ready for bed. I turn off all the lights in my house, locked all doors, and made sure every window was locked shut. I walk in my room and I’m just hanging out watching an episode of a series before bed, and I notice that lucky isn’t in my room. \n\n“Lucky come” I say with my door open and all the lights off outside of my room. He’s a very obedient dog and whatever I tell him to do he always listens, but this time he wasn’t listening.. \n\nSo I get up from the futon, king is already asleep so I’m not worried about him. KEEP IN MIND I walk out and look for him without turning on any lights, the only light on is from my room so the light shines from a distance. \n\n\n“Lucky let’s go to bed” I said to lucky looking at him, I look to my right and lucky is looking at me tilting my head, kind of letting me know “I’m right here ?” \n\nMy heart drops and I look back to my left and there it is. The dark figure with yellow eyes. Without hesitation I grab lucky and run to my room and place him with king. \n\nI was frozen for a minute because I’m home alone and growing up I’ve always seen things, but not to this extent. \n\nI say fuck it and grab my baseball bat and turn on every single light on as I’m running, passing each light switch. \n\nI turn on the living room light and it was gone. I searched everywhere and double checked everything.. it just disappeared. \n\nI was genuinely afraid to sleep so I stayed up until I closed my eyes. \n\nI wonder what that figure was. I never saw it again.\n",

She has always had pretty regular poops, and occasionally will throw up empty belly bile in the morning if she doesn't eat enough. We took her to the vet for the diarrhea and they said her pancreas was fine and her stool sample was normal. She rarely goes unmonitored, is leashed at all times outside, and did not eat anything as far as we were concerned. It was very random diarrhea and we did not find a cause. They gave her pro pectalin every 8 hours, a probiotic for once a day, and a medication that we gave her through a syringe every 12 hours (cannot recall the name). We did this for a week and she stopped having diarrhea very quickly. It's going on 4 or so days since we stopped the pro pectalin and squeeze (she still has a few pro biotics) and I feel like she has yet to return to a normal pooping schedule. Is this normal? She tends to poop now once a day in the late afternoon, when she used to poop twice a day on schedule. I would also say her appetite seems a bit lacking but not gone completely, just irregular. The poops are larger now that it's once and fairly soft. Not diarrhea, just soft. Not sure if I should be concerned or if it is normal to experience a change after a week of that medication? When should I be concerned about the change and taking her back to the vet? They said soon, but I'm not sure if I should give her stomach more time to reset. ",

I pay rent, do lighthouse keeping in the common areas and cook at least 2x per week using my own money to purchase the food that ALL 3 of us then eat.  The problem here is that both of my \"roommates\" , father (70M) aka \"landlord=LL\") and son (36M=RM) seem to think that living like slobs is a way of life. When I first moved in it took me 3 days to get this place to even look inhabitable for a human. A little over a year ago I got extremely ill and was bed bound for about 7 months until it got so bad that I ended up in the hospital for 30 days. After I was released, I came back and the house looked like a tornado + hurricane + pack rats hit it. And I'm not just talking things laying around. I am talking about dirty dishes all over counter directly above the EMPTY dishwasher, sinks so filthy I wouldn't let a dog drink out of it if it had water in it, glass beer bottles lined up on the kitchen floor (LL), delivery boxes (RM), filthy kitchen floor/countertops etc, filthy main bathroom (RM misses the toilet type stuff), soap scum, puffs of dust bunnies and his curly hair all over the floor, AROUND the garbage can, not in it, carpets that haven't been vacuumed  for the whole time I was ill, kitchen floor not swept or mopped and I can't handle much more.  I WILL NOT clean either of their bedrooms or the master bath.  (EWEEEE). But everyone is saying \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth\". It's not like I live here for free!  I'm on full disability due to health, both physical and mental health reasons.  I try and survive on less than $1500 per month.  I'm not here to complain about that!  The problem is, in my area, about 30 miles south of Seattle, the rent on a 1 bedroom apartment, and not a very nice one, is $1,350 per month.  Hell, a studio is $1,250 per month.  I am very grateful to at least have a roof over my head, but I feel at this point I am being taken advantage of and treated more like an unpaid live-in housekeeper/cook.  I looked up how much the average salary for a live in housekeeper is in my area and was SHOCKED to find that the \"Average Monthly Pay: $5,257\" !!! (Directly taken from Internet research).  Would I be overreacting or even overreaching to say ok, this is what it would cost, conservatively, to live in my area so I would like at least $2,000 in \"wages\".?

(I learned about littermate syndrome so for the most part we were good about allowing them to be individuals and have never had any issues because of them being from same litter)  I am very aware of the working dog inside of them so we try to play fetch as much as possible and they run together in my yard all day long! \n\nAbout six months ago I began to allow them to spend most of the days outside as we have an invisible dog fence. They love being outside so much I have been contemplating just building them kennels or a shelter outside for bedtime since they only really come inside anymore at bedtime. (Which they seem to love so I have been hesitant on having them sleep in an outdoor kennel)\n\nRiver has always jumped up an although not preferred… and he is about 50 pounds. We didn’t completely curb the habit and I am so regretful. Now when I let him out of his kennel in the morning to go straight outside he begins to jump up as high as possibly (literally as to the point where he nips my hair) \n\nHowever now we are at a point where he keeps jumping up and jumping up and getting worked up to where he will start to get VERY ROUGH and become semi aggressive. I would love to post a video because it is the strangest thing. I don’t know how to fix this! 😭I have raised several Australian shepherds (all mostly from the same family) so i’m not sure why he’s giving me so much trouble. His poor brother will get sort of upset he’s doing that to me and then he starts to try to get between us. They never fight so it’s fine I just am so worried because I don’t want him to attack me and I would never get rid of him for this when it is my fault as I have let the jumping behavior go on for so long! (Keep in mind they only do this to me and not my partner, he can just give them a look and they are running for the hills - He has never been abusive, he has just always been the stern one. It’s just becoming such an issue because I work from home so I am the one alone with them most of the time! If he is home he can quickly get him to stop jumping on me like that in a matter of seconds. Any help would be appreciated! I am not looking for a magic solution, vet advice or actual dog training advice but any information is appreciated and welcomed 💗 I was just mostly curious if anyone has dealt with something like this, or how I could become more like my partner in the aspect that they do not jump on me! I think that would really fix it because he never is actually aggressive - it’s more like he gets way too worked up. (I have tried ignoring the behavior, which seems to make it worse)\n",

I was rooting hard for them as underdogs and because of their unforgettable run, but deep down I legitimately thought They would struggle to win one game against the Thunder. It sucks because before Hali's injury I was planning on keeping an eye on them next season, I still will but some of that excitement is definitely gone knowing one of their best players is out for the entire season.

He's also a great 'guard dog' in that he barks at strangers and alerts us to people nearby.  He's also super patient and tolerant of our small kids (ages 2-6).  \n\nI have always wanted a Great Pyrenees because they possess many of the traits I'd want in a dog, but I'd prefer a mix because we don't own a farm (we do have half an acre of fenced yard though) and I also heard their trainability is difficult, specifically recall is horrible and that's one of the many things I appreciate about our current dog.  \n\nI have found some adoptable puppies in my state (two separate litters) one is a mix of mainly GSD with some GP &amp; a tiny bit of Husky mixed in.  The other is GP and Golden mix.  \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with similar mixes who can provide some overall insight?  I'd like a family dog who can be both relaxed and active, has some guard dog tendencies/abilities and is good with kids.   ",

She has had a few accidents over the years but it was always my fault tbh. In the past couple months, she's been going potty in the kitchen after we go to bed. I tell her \"goodnight\" and let her outside before bed, like I always do, but she won't go potty in the yard unless I'm out there begging/telling her to go. And it's not like she listens right away. Is my dog just being an asshole or am I doing something wrong?\n\nI can't think of much thats changed; no new people in the house, same food, same schedules, the only difference I can think of is I haven't been taking her for a walk *every* day, which I do in the mornings anyways. I have looked through the yard and can't find anything that would be scaring her or making her afraid to be outside.\n\nAlso, when I clean it up, I point it out to her, like \"what's this?\" and then make her go outside and I tell her \"go potty outside\" but that hasn't seemed to be helpful.

          "Post Text": "I’m not sure if it is safe to talk about this here but I’m just going to start right off the bat to rip the Band-Aid off: I am having a hard time keeping from watching pornography. As a wife and as a Christian, I know it’s wrong to think about. I also know and understand that it’s not my husband’s fault but my own. We have two different libidos in the first place and we only have sex maybe once a month, when he’s in the mood. Part of the reason why we (especially him) don’t want to do it as often is because we don’t want to have kids yet. Even with condoms, we still are trying to be very careful. Although I was on birth control at one point, and it did make me sick , he told me he no longer wanted me on it because it could mess up my system., yet , he has made it very clear he doesn’t want any children right now. It’s a little pointless to be on them anyways because we don’t do it often. He goes back-and-forth from time to time, saying that if we have them now it wouldn’t be a big deal, and then the next second he’s paranoid and expresses how much he wants to save more money, which is understandable… We just bought a house and we’re slowly trying to make it more of a home with fixing some little repairs. I understand he’s going through a lot with working a lot and trying to keep up mentally with his place in our lives, as am I with working and being available and etc..\n\nBut I just don’t remember it being this way before we married… there is almost a 180’ with how things are turning out with our relationship… we used to be like best friends…\n\nAnother part of where I am with this is how I feel as though I get the leftovers of his time and energy. He’s very close to his family(his mother, his father, his brother), something I’ve always admired. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a tad jealous of how much attention he shows to them. Even when it comes to plans., if they have last minute plans that includes wanting him to be in, he will drop his own plans or our plans to center around them. There’s kind of a long story with where I am in these scenarios, but to make it short enough, I will say that whatever they want it goes and if I don’t like it or if I have concerns or if I’m not included/clued in the details, it’s either my problem or I’m making things a big deal and I need to “be the bigger person”/“stop overthinking”.\n\nHe has tried to include me into everything they do and I have always shown up in the past, but there has been an instance where it has been brought to my attention by someone in his family of how I’m someone interfering with their relationship and that I need to be watched because they always have to look out for him…. There have been some deceitful things happened, and there are things that I can’t unsee or understand feel… I’ve been to therapy myself few times… And things are now a little better between me and his folks with boundaries that I’ve put in place.\n\nbut I try to communicate numerous times with him but each time he is apparently clueless of what’s happening and he will apologize for how I feel… we “talk” about going to therapy together, but when I ask when we should start, he doesn’t have an answer… when I make suggestions on who to go to, suddenly he wants to go to a specific kind (has to be a man, has to be Christian based, etc), yet there hasn’t been much effort—\n\nI’ll leave that there.\n\nJust as I’ve mentioned with how I feel that our relationship has turned a 180, one example is that any time I try to connect with him or talk to him or share something funny with him, he’s tired, or will NOW as of recent month, have no problem bluntly telling me he “doesn’t care” and will walk off to go do something else. This has never happened before. But he will talk on the phone about any and everything with his family including Ideas about how we should decorate the house, what furniture they have given us and more to give us and ideas on where to set it., what renovations we should do with one room and another, &amp; etc. when it’s brought up to me, it’s just an afterthought. When I expressed that I don’t feel much involved because it feels like it’s only his house with only his ideas and whomever he considers to take advice from, he doesn’t seem to get it or will start the cycle of being clueless and then apologizing for how I feel, and then talks of therapy.\n\nBut when I pull away and let him have his space and  let him have it his way, and I find shows to watch or I’m on my phone, or something else to do, then all of a sudden I’m being “problematic” or “distant”  to him or, as he says, he thinks I don’t want to be here., even though I feel as though he doesn’t want me here… He either has the better idea, or will steal my ideas and make it his own, or will constantly tell me what someone else said would be a good fit/idea for us.\n\nI have even apologized and self reflected, and have included that I may need to make connections outside of our relationship, and go out more, because that is something that I have actually lost since dating him., trying to always be available for him and being at his back and call, or being his puppy dog.  Maybe I’m being codependent and have unrealistic expectations…  I asked him if there’s anything he needed from me or if I need to show up in a way he needs me to, but he says there’s nothing I’m doing wrong, and that he loves me for who I am….\n\nI go to the gym and do volunteer work and have rekindled some lost relationships/friendships, but sometimes I will cancel because he’ll talk me out of it or will sabotage in some way, or I’ll be too exhausted from doing things to keep up with him…. I’m trying not to sound nitpicky or that I don’t appreciate him, because I do from the bottom of my heart, I love him… I just don’t want to be taken for granted either… I don’t know… I’m running in circles with this post but: point is:\n\nWe don’t have sex, we don’t connect anymore, and he doesn’t seem to care at all as long as his needs are met. I contribute to our savings —that only he has direct access to— not as much as him, but it is still needed as back up., everything is in his name besides my phone., I don’t want to sound negative or that I have fear/doubt of our relationship, but I definitely feel cornered, a bit isolated, and lonely.",

I pay rent, do lighthouse keeping in the common areas and cook at least 2x per week using my own money to purchase the food that ALL 3 of us then eat.  The problem here is that both of my \"roommates\" , father (70M) aka \"landlord=LL\") and son (36M=RM) seem to think that living like slobs is a way of life. When I first moved in it took me 3 days to get this place to even look inhabitable for a human. A little over a year ago I got extremely ill and was bed bound for about 7 months until it got so bad that I ended up in the hospital for 30 days. After I was released, I came back and the house looked like a tornado + hurricane + pack rats hit it. And I'm not just talking things laying around. I am talking about dirty dishes all over counter directly above the EMPTY dishwasher, sinks so filthy I wouldn't let a dog drink out of it if it had water in it, glass beer bottles lined up on the kitchen floor (LL), delivery boxes (RM), filthy kitchen floor/countertops etc, filthy main bathroom (RM misses the toilet type stuff), soap scum, puffs of dust bunnies and his curly hair all over the floor, AROUND the garbage can, not in it, carpets that haven't been vacuumed  for the whole time I was ill, kitchen floor not swept or mopped and I can't handle much more.  I WILL NOT clean either of their bedrooms or the last bath.  (EWEEEE). But everyone is saying \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth\". It's not like I live here for free!  I'm on full disability due to health, both physical and mental health reasons.  I try and survive on less than $1500 per month.  I'm not here to complain about that!  The problem is, in my area, about 30 miles south of Seattle, the rent on a 1 bedroom apartment, and not a very nice one, is $1,350 per month.  Hell, a studio is $1,250 per month.  I am very grateful to at least have a roof over my head, but I feel at this point I am being taken advantage of and treated more like an unpaid live-in housekeeper/cook.  I looked up how much the average salary for a live in housekeeper is in my area and was SHOCKED to find that the \"Average Monthly Pay: $5,257\" !!! (Directly taken from Internet research).  Would I be overreacting or even overreaching to say ok, this is what it would cost, conservatively, to live in my area so I would like at least $2,000 in \"wages\".?  Please, any advise or thoughts are very welcome!! Thanks for reading. ",

I have the back of my car set up so he can stay comfortably back there (hard cover and his attached crash harness) he has more than enough space to move around. About ninety percent of the time he tries to jump at a car that passes us and smashes his face against my rear view window. I have exhausted the valuable food rewards in the car, I have even used his positive marker (yes) when he looks in the cars direction (pre-attack). He’s absolutely fine when he has something of high value to chew on, but as soon as he’s done he’s hurting himself trying to get these cars. Any tips? I’d also like to say that outside of being in the car, he has minimal issues with cars passing us on the road whilst walking. ",

Quite a few were simply due to me burning out in this final stretch and taking risks that I didn't need to or misreading trainers teams.\n\n**Ultra Necrozma, Elite Four &amp; Champion**\n\n\\- Ultra Necrozma was surprisingly easy thanks to focus sash Topsy-Turvy Malamar into a 1 hit by Zeus.\n\n\\- Molayne was the easiest E4 member, Misty Terrain from Zeus to prevent Paralysis allowed for safe setup and sweep by Ra.\n\n\\- Olivia's lead Armaldo didn't have the damage to prevent 2 swords dances into 1 hit by Anubis, but Thunder wave from Probopass meant that I couldn't safely sweep past it due to a paralysis on Gigalith, Fernir and Zeus double teamed for the kill before Puppy got sent out and immediately killed by her Z-Move. Fernir was able to return and roost until Stone Edge Missed so he could finish her last 2 mons.\n\n\\- Acerola also interrupted by attempted sweep thanks to screech and shadow claw knocking Zeus too low to safely continue. Ra set up a single quiver dance before he broke out of confusion and I went with it to sweep the rest of her team.\n\n\\- Puppy's death on Olivia meant I had to improvise, Fernir taking out her lead. Then Flatter giving Zeus the boost needed to 1 hit Mandibuzz. Fernir came back in to 1v1 Hawlucha and chip Toucannon for Zeus to finish. Syl finished the fight with Psychic.\n\n\\- Champion fight was even easier than Molayne with Ra setting up and sweeping the whole team himself.\n\n**Deaths:**\n\n\\- Aurora (Amarua) first serious death, she got pursuit trapped during the first Gladion fight as I thought she was a bit tankier.\n\n\\- Horje (Mudbray) no stamina so I'm not too broken up about it, she went down in 1 hit to Totem Marowak.\n\n\\- Aquiette (Brionne) a low roll tricked me into believing she could tank a hit but got crit by Totem Marowak.\n\n\\- Dancer (Oricorio) Screech plus Solar Blade from Totem Lurantis took her out.\n\n\\- Mikey (Primeape) Bounce and Steel wing during the Totem Togedemaru fight after knocking it low.\n\n\\- Aussie (Komala) had to be sacrificed to get sleep on Totem Togedemaru and Skarmory.\n\n\\- Petal (Tsareena) somehow got outsped by a trainers Honchcrow just before Totem Mimikyu\n\n\\- Helios (Anorith) Died to the same Honchcrow in 1 hit, if not for Chomps Intimidate might have lost the run.\n\n\\- Sol (Staryu) Veteran Angus hit much harder than I was expecting and I had to sac.\n\n\\- Della (Skarmory) got revenge for Sol but went down to rough skin.\n\n\\- Dryad (Lurantis) I really have a problem with getting double teamed during double battles.\n\n\\- Lisa (Salazzle) Can someone explain how Guzma's Pinsir outsped Salazzle with a +speed nature?\n\n\\- Sailor (Pelipper) Crit Air Slash during the Aether Guzma fight.\n\n\\- Wimpy (Golisopod) I forgot that sucker punch has higher priority than First Impression.\n\n\\- Chomps (Mawile) Had to be sacrificed for a safe switch on Lusamine's Milotic.\n\n\\- Bandit (Scrafty) had to be thrown out on Milotic after Lusamine threw by going for Icy wind on Anubis then flail? Which wouldn't have killed Anubis but meant I had to sacrifice Bandit to prevent a death on switching back in.\n\n\\- Lily (Ninetales) Earthquake Crit through Aurora veil in Vast Poni Canyon.\n\n\\- Big Boss (Murkrow) Sac on Mina Ribombee for a safe pivot cause I forgot to change my team after Ultra Necrozma.\n\n\\- Bomb (Graveler) died to Pelipper during Totem Ribombee trying to explode.\n\n\\- Alora (Tyranitar) I forgot about Z-moves and got him killed during Hapu Kahuna fight.",

More than she’s been through her entire teenager phase. Just causing trouble whenever she feels like it - and maintaining eye contact when she does it like she KNOWS she’s being a menace. She’s super friendly but incredibly over excited with other dogs and people. We are working on this through lots of training and every now and then I can see her trying to control herself to varying degrees of success. But ultimately the unhinged queen of chaos reigns.\n\nIs it normal for an extra regression at 18 months? It’s been a couple weeks of this and I really don’t want this to be the normal.

It's live here in /r/movies, and he'll be back at 3 PM ET today to answer questions:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lj9ld3/hey_rmovies_im_brian_truitt_usa_todays_movie/\n\nI recommend asking inn advance. Any question/comment is much appreciated :)\n\nMore info from him:\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nHey r/movies!\n\nSummer blockbusters have been a cinematic tradition ever since Steven Spielberg’s Jaws took a bite out of the box office in 1975. To mark the 50th anniversary of that game-changing moment, I put together a list for USA TODAY of the 50 best blockbusters released since then — from superhero spectacles to sci-fi epics and everything in between.\n\nI’m Brian Truitt, movie critic at USA TODAY. I’m a native Northern Virginian, girl dad of one daughter, dog father to three adorable Boston Terriers, and a lifelong pop-culture fiend who’s spent the last 15 years writing for the Nation’s Newspaper. I review movies, rank pretty much everything from Marvel movies to football films, and sometimes get to talk with the likes of Stephen King and George Clooney.\n\nOne of my best movie memories from when I was a kid was in 1983, when I was 7. My mom picked me up from school for opening night of “Return of the Jedi.” There was a line around the mall, and we had to wait for two hours, but Jabba the Hutt, Ewoks and Admiral Ackbar were so worth it.\n\nMy list, ranked worst to best:\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/06/20/best-summer-blockbuster-movies-ranked/84056437007/\n\nGet some popcorn and let’s dive into the world of summer movies — ask me anything!

          "Post Text": "To make a long story short, I have a 2009 Honda Accord V6 with 135k that should probably go away soon because of the cost of repairs building up. I test drove a few things, but was utterly underwhelmed because I realized I have been used to driving faster cars and fast responding cars. So I need help choosing. Below is a comprehensive list of cars I have driven and liked, and why. I owe nothing on the Accord and would use it as a down payment, and hopefully still get something good out of it. As for a car payment, I can afford $500 a month. I also need something that's faster. I live in Texas with all these speed demons, and the Accord's agility has definitely saved my ass quite a few times.\n\nTo get it out of the way, different members of the family have the entire XC line from Volvo. I like the 2025 XC60 B5 AWD the best out of anything I've ever been in, but I'm not stupid; that is way out of my price range. I like how fast it moves, the safety features, and the responsiveness of the brakes. Next would be the 2020 XC40 T5 AWD, same as the XC60 but a bit lighter, so you have to manage acceleration more, I've found. Lastly, my mom is a certified trophy wife, so she has a 2021 XC90 T6 Inscription. The sports mode is glorious, but the car feels like a boat, and I'm not towing around 3 children and 2 dogs. \n\nNext would be the 2017 Ford Explorer XLT, mileage is kinda meh but damn that thing can move and I think its responsiveness is comparable to the XC60. As far as I know, the only repairs on the one I've driven (also family owned) were all cosmetic, and so far, so good on everything else. \n\nI've been in a 2013 F-150 XLT, and that was also fun, but it kinda had the same feeling as the XC90, and is too big for me. The most out-of-left-field vehicle I enjoyed was a 2010 Dodge Dakota that my best friend has. It was a little sluggish, but it also has 190k miles on it, so that's expected. I also really enjoy the Jettas from VW. Lastly, I test drove a Subaru 2025 Crosstrek Premium, and though it was on the slow side, its features are comparable to the Volvos, and the thought of owning that car for upwards of 15 years is hard to pass up. I'm looking at another one soon. \n\nI haven't been in a Camry, and I know I need to. \n\nAs for dislikes, the 2023 Mazda3, 2025 Civic, 2015 Chevy Traverse, and the 2017 Yukon Denali XL (my grandpa retired, can you really blame him?). I found all of these cars to be a bit too slow for me, the Civic was too bland for the price, and the Traverse just feels weird. And, of course, the Denali was just a hazard. ",

They are both mixed-breed dogs and weigh no more than 10 kg.\n\nOlly has never given us any problems. However, no matter how hard we try, Arya still urinates and defecates in the house EVERY day, even in places like the sofa, the beds, and her own bed... She doesn't let you know when she wants to go out; she just does it wherever she wants.\n\nWe've tried everything; from taking her for walks every hour, taking her to the vet several times, and even taking her to two ethologists, but in these seven years, we haven't seen any improvement. In fact, things are getting worse, as today she does everything in the house, even going out 10 times a day...\n\nNow this has become a BIG PROBLEM, as a few months ago we had a daughter and she's just starting to crawl... We tried buying a playpen for the dog, but the moment you put her inside she starts barking for hours, disturbing the neighbors...\n\nWhat can we do? I have my daughter in a playpen without letting her explore, while the dog is free in the living room, urinating and defecating wherever she pleases... This morning when we woke up there were several pees (one of them on the sofa) and three piles of poop... The living room was a real mess and smelled terrible.\n\nWe don't want to get rid of her, but it's hell living like this...",

We had the means to give her the best life, gave her complete medical needs and sent her off properly. We fought bravely and we were given time to say farewell.

The before-work crowd was still streaming in, corporate-looking men and corporate-looking women hurriedly ordering coffees and sandwiches at the counter before rushing to the office.\n\nJo and I sat in our usual booth, tucked away in the corner of the room and pressed up against a large street-side window.

Jo liked to watch as people scurried about on their way to work, and she’d said that sitting by the window was the only way to do it fairly, so that they could watch us too.\n\nThe nine-o-clock sun was spilled across our table, warming us on an otherwise chilly February morning.\n\nJo stuffed her cigarette into the ashtray which sat between our coffees and smiled at me.\n\n“What was she like?”\n\nHer question startled me.\n\nIt had seemed some sort of unwritten law between us to never speak of it.\n\nThat being said, it was the anniversary of the whole damned thing. Seven years. It hardly seemed possible.\n\nHad Jo known that, or was her asking just a strange coincidence? I guessed I’d shared the date with her at some point, during a long-ago conversation in a distant, forgotten corner.\n\nI cleared my throat. Jo continued to smile toward me.\n\n“If you don’t want to talk about her, it’s okay.”\n\n“Um,” I managed.\n\n“No, really, it’s okay.” She took a small sip from her mug, momentarily looking away.\n\nI suddenly felt warm all over. The heat rose from my chest to my head and went back down again, with no way to get out.\n\nIt’s a funny thing to lose someone when you’re young and invincible, and twenty-seven is still that, and then to be thirty-four and still somewhat broken, but mended, so that the scar yet shows under the right lighting but doesn’t hurt so much anymore.\n\nI didn’t know how to respond. It had been so long since I’d last talked about her.\n\n“I’m sorry, Jack. Really, forget I even brought it up.”\n\nThe sunlight glistened off of Jo’s wedding band, still new and mostly un-scuffed, blinding my eyes and turning everything amber.\n\nI remembered much about her, but the memories were no longer clear, like old video tape that had been worn out and recorded over.\n\nThere were smiles and tears and laughter and arguments and forgiveness, over and over again, all unspooled and jumbled up together.\n\nI saw once-familiar places and old friends and long drives home and her leaning out of the sun-roof of my dad’s car, shouting at the moon and laughing hard, and that CD was probably still in there somewhere, tucked under the passenger seat forever.\n\nThere was sneaking through my bedroom window and fumbling around in the dark and falling in love and heading off to college but still making it work.\n\nI remembered that first apartment together when there was no money, and then suddenly a lot of it, but nothing different between the two of us expect for the growing wrinkles around our eyes and my hair growing thinner, and there was a dog named for a movie we liked and a view of the city and a candle always lit on the dining room table.\n\nAnd then there was none of it.\n\nSuddenly and abruptly and unfairly and foully, but there was nothing that could be done about that now.\n\nHer mom and dad, and mine were already gone, and her brothers and sisters that had become my own but were no longer, and all of those friends were ours together and it wasn’t right to have them on my own so I didn’t anymore.\n\nNothing to be done about it but continuing to move forward and smiling through it all and working to forget and trying not to remember. Yes, that was the way to do it.\n\nShe had told me once that when she was a kid, she’d tell the other children that the “S” which started her name stood for “smiley,” and I think it must have because that’s what I most remembered, but she hadn’t been smiling in the casket and I didn’t know what to do about that.\n\nAnd I felt my cheeks growing hot and wet and everything was starting to burn and I couldn’t stop myself from remembering it all until the tape was put back to the reels and tucked away somewhere.\n\nHer smile was gone forever and I wasn’t sure how to answer Jo so I just sat there. I noticed through the amber that her smile was gone now, too.\n\n“Okay—which one of you had the breakfast platter?”\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\n“Um,” I managed.\n\nThe waitress set it down in front of me and put Jo’s food in front of her.\n\n“Let me know if you two need anything else!”\n\nAnd that was all I could remember and Jo didn’t want to know anymore and I couldn’t tell her anything about it anyway.\n\nThat was an old love and this one was new and my coffee was growing cold, so I ordered some more and we sat there in silence until the people stopped walking past our window.",

My golden is 3 years old currently and the vet said he is not very concerned but better prevention and getting it done in earlier stages than later when it could possibly get worse. \n\nThis is my first dog and I’ve never had friends with dogs previously so just wondering whether this is a normal procedure that most dog owners do eventually? I haven’t heard of anyone else doing it. They will be putting him under anesthesia for the procedure hence another reason why I’m unsure about it as it’s not “urgent” per se. \n\n",

          "Post Text": "I’m not sure if it is safe to talk about this here but I’m just going to start right off the bat to rip the Band-Aid off:\n I am having a hard time keeping from watching pornography. As a wife and as a Christian, I know it’s wrong to think about. I also know and understand that it’s not my husband’s fault but my own. \nWe have two different libidos in the first place and we only have sex maybe once a month, when he’s in the mood. Part of the reason why we (especially him) don’t want to do it as often is because we don’t want to have kids yet. Even with condoms, we still are trying to be very careful. Although I was on birth control at one point, and it did make me sick , he told me he no longer wanted me on it because it could mess up my system., yet , he has made it very clear he doesn’t want any children right now. It’s a little pointless to be on them anyways because we don’t do it often. He goes back-and-forth from time to time, saying that if we have them now it wouldn’t be a big deal, and then the next second he’s paranoid and expresses how much he wants to save more money, which is understandable… We just bought a house and we’re slowly trying to make it more of a home with fixing some little repairs. I understand he’s going through a lot with working a lot and trying to keep up mentally with his place in our lives, as am I with working and being available and etc.. \n\nBut I just don’t remember it being this way before we married… there is almost a 180’ with how things are turning out with our relationship… we used to be like best friends… \n\nAnother part of where I am with this is how I feel as though I get the leftovers of his time and energy. \nHe’s very close to his family(his mother, his father, his brother), something I’ve always admired. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a tad jealous of how much attention he shows to them. Even when it comes to plans., if they have last minute plans that includes wanting him to be in, he will drop his own plans or our plans to center around them. There’s kind of a long story with where I am in these scenarios, but to make it short enough, I will say that whatever they want it goes and if I don’t like it or if I have concerns or if I’m not included/clued in the details, it’s either my problem or I’m making things a big deal and I need to “be the bigger person”/“stop overthinking”. \n\nHe has tried to include me into everything they do and I have always shown up in the past, but there has been an instance where it has been brought to my attention by someone in his family of how I’m someone interfering with their relationship and that I need to be watched because they always have to look out for him…. There have been some deceitful things happened, and there are things that I can’t unsee or understand feel… I’ve been to therapy myself few times…\nAnd things are now a little better between me and his folks with boundaries that I’ve put in place. \n\nbut I try to communicate numerous times with him but each time he is apparently clueless of what’s happening and he will apologize for how I feel… we “talk” about going to therapy together, but when I ask when we should start, he doesn’t have an answer… when I make suggestions on who to go to, suddenly he wants to go to a specific kind (has to be a man, has to be Christian based, etc), yet there hasn’t been much effort—\n\nI’ll leave that there.\n\n\n\nJust as I’ve mentioned with how I feel that our relationship has turned a 180, one example is that any time I try to connect with him or talk to him or share something funny with him, he’s tired, or will NOW as of recent month, have no problem bluntly telling me he “doesn’t care” and will walk off to go do something else. This has never happened before. But he will talk on the phone about any and everything with his family including Ideas about how we should decorate the house, what furniture they have given us and more to give us and ideas on where to set it., what renovations we should do with one room and another, &amp; etc. when it’s brought up to me, it’s just an afterthought. When I expressed that I don’t feel much involved because it feels like it’s only his house with only his ideas and whomever he considers to take advice from, he doesn’t seem to get it or will start the cycle of being clueless and then apologizing for how I feel, and then talks of therapy. \n\nBut when I pull away and let him have his space and  let him have it his way, and I find shows to watch or I’m on my phone, or something else to do, \nthen all of a sudden I’m being “problematic” or “distant”  to him or, as he says, he thinks I don’t want to be here., \neven though I feel as though he doesn’t want me here… \nHe either has the better idea, or will steal my ideas and make it his own, or will constantly tell me what someone else said would be a good fit/idea for us.\n\n\nI have even apologized and self reflected, and have included that I may need to make connections outside of our relationship, and go out more, because that is something that I have actually lost since dating him., trying to always be available for him and being at his back and call, or being his puppy dog.  Maybe I’m being codependent and have unrealistic expectations…  I asked him if there’s anything he needed from me or if I need to show up in a way he needs me to, but he says there’s nothing I’m doing wrong, and that he loves me for who I am….\n\nI go to the gym and do volunteer work and have rekindled some lost relationships/friendships, but sometimes I will cancel because he’ll talk me out of it or will sabotage in some way, or I’ll be too exhausted from doing things to keep up with him…. \nI’m trying not to sound nitpicky or that I don’t appreciate him, because I do from the bottom of my heart, I love him… \nI just don’t want to be taken for granted either… \nI don’t know… \nI’m running in circles with this post but:\npoint is: \n\nWe don’t have sex, we don’t connect anymore, and he doesn’t seem to care at all as long as his needs are met. \nI contribute to our savings —that only he has direct access to— not as much as him, but it is still needed as back up., everything is in his name besides my phone., I don’t want to sound negative or that I have fear/doubt of our relationship, but I definitely feel cornered, a bit isolated, and lonely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I’m a junior in college living off campus in a really dog-friendly area, and I’ve been seriously thinking about getting an emotional support dog (ESA, not a service dog).\n\nThis came up with my therapist after I dog-sat and cat-sat for a friend earlier this year (about a week each). \n\nIt honestly made such a difference. When I had the dog, I felt more stable, more social, and way more motivated day to day. My therapist agrees that having an ESA could really help support my mental health in the long term.\n\nSo here’s where I’m at:\n\nI’ve got a remote part-time job and a pretty relaxed school schedule. \n\nI live walking distance from campus, so I can easily head home between classes if I need to let a dog out. \n\nI’ve been saving for a while with this in mind, and I’ve talked a lot with my family about it. They’re really supportive and have offered to help with vet bills or any emergencies if I ever run into trouble; even after I graduate. \n\nI’m planning to move back home for a bit after college while job searching, and I’ve already done a few internships in marketing and comms, so I feel like I’m in a pretty stable place to take this on (or as stable as one can be in this job market Jesus.) \n\n\nTDLR;\nIf you have any advice or experiences, I’d love to hear them:\nHave you had an ESA, or do you know someone who has?\nAny tips on how to choose the right dog, especially while in college?\nWhat breeds or temperaments tend to do best in this kind of lifestyle?\nAnything you wish you’d known before getting your dog?\n\nLiterally any insight is welcome, Thanks so much in advance :)",

My neighbor usually brings his dog there, always unleashed to play around. There has never been any issues. We’ve both been here years. My dog is always in my private terrace behind a fence. When we do go out in the common area, he is always leashed. I always avoid going out when anyone at all is there in the common area and always take him out there only at night for a quick pee before bed. But there has been many occasions, when I’m walking my dog and suddenly the neighbor’s dog comes running, barking at my dog. Usually she stops short of biting distance and I always pull my dog back, while her owner, my neighbor comes running to carry the Pomeranian back. In the back of my mind I always had this feeling that something bad could happen someday.\nYesterday, well we’re in Qatar, and there were literally missiles flying around in the sky. I came out to the common area to get a better look and my dog was with me leashed as usual. To understand, it’s a huge space with lots of plants and bushes and you can’t tell who is around. The Pomeranian was there around a corner and I didn’t see her and she came running again at my dog but this time didn’t stop short and went all in and somehow while I tried to pull my dog back, he caught her and tried to shake her. I got him to release her but by then he had bit her and she started shrieking. Meanwhile the neighbor came running too and got her and it was overall very very stressful for everyone. I mean you could hear missiles getting shot out from the sky and everyone was super scared and in the middle of it all this happened. Anyway they took her to the vet and she got some stitches, there were a couple of deep wounds. Thank God nothing worse happened. But I feel terrible. I love the small dog and play with her a lot as well. I’ve a shihtzu too and she’s best friends with the Pomeranian. I don’t know how I could have prevented it. I offered to pay for all the vet bills but I feel horrible and I don’t know how to face my neighbor anymore.",

Upon pulling these carpets, beautiful oak (we think) floors were revealed. The floor was in pretty rough shape so we spent two days sanding it down to bare wood, it took a lot but it already looks way better. We returned the next day hoping to buff and apply our first layer of clear coat, but found these wet spots in various places around the house. After sniffing the spots we are pretty sure that this is dog or cat pee. What can we do to extract the pee from the wood that won't damage or burn our floor? ",

          "Post Text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/PuresNightmares/comments/1lj14o9/first_shift_at_the_high_desert_research_annex/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/PuresNightmares/comments/1lj5993/2300_tunnel_patrol_notes_from_the_first_loop/)\n\n**Log Start: 04:13**\n\nI’ve just finished the 0300 patrol. Writing this while everything’s still locked in my head. If I wait, I’ll start minimizing things, rounding corners that shouldn’t be rounded. That’s how your brain keeps you functional when things stop making sense—it throws out what doesn’t fit the pattern. That’s dangerous.\n\nSo this is going to be longer than it needs to be, and a little messy. I’ll clean it up for the report log later.\n\nFor now: here’s everything. Exactly how it happened.\n\n**PRE-PATROL**\n\nI stepped out of the Security Hub at 02:57.\n\nThe temperature had dropped another three degrees, officially 30°F. But it felt colder. The kind of cold that doesn’t hit your skin first—it goes for your joints, like it knows where the pain already lives. My bad knee twinged the moment my boot hit gravel. That’s become my barometer for when something’s off: pain that knows things before I do.\n\nThe perimeter lights came on late.\n\nThey’re motion triggered, but the first three didn’t flicker on until I was already under them. That’s a deviation of at least a half second per unit. I clocked it. Wrote it down. The lights weren’t dim. They were… hesitant. Like they had to think about it. Same hum underfoot as always, the subterranean vibration that never quite stops—but it was slower, deeper. Like someone turned the volume down, but not the source.\n\nThe path was wrong tonight.\n\nNot visually. Just spatially. I walked the same number of steps as usual. Counted them: 42 from the Hub door to the outer airlock. But it *felt* longer. Like the land stretched a little farther while I wasn’t looking. Don’t ask me how I know that. Some things you just register in your bones.\n\n**AIRLOCK ENTRY: 02:59**\n\nThe vestibule took longer to cycle. 11 seconds instead of 8. I watched the pressure gauge blink—once, twice, pause—then complete. Might be recalibrating. Might not. When the inner door hissed open, I smelled bleach again, but only faintly this time. Like something trying to cover its tracks after it’s already too late.\n\nI stepped inside. Hallway lights activated, full brightness, instant reaction.\n\nThat’s when I saw the floor.\n\n**THE FOOTPRINTS**\n\nThere were wet spots along the corridor floor—irregular patches, not pooled, but definite. Not fresh mop water. The consistency was wrong. Slightly viscous. Almost like cleaning gel that hadn’t been diluted.\n\nI paused at the first corner—about ten meters in—and crouched.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw the **prints**.\n\nNot stains. Not boot scuffs. Actual wet footprints. Clear tread. Forefoot-heavy, pointed slightly inward. Human gait, but off-center. Left foot favored. Slight drag at toe-off.\n\nThey weren’t mine.\n\nI wear standard Client-issue hex soles. These were chevron-patterned. Mid-weight, maybe tactical work boots, size 10–11 by guess. Whoever made them was walking with intention, but not confidence. Heel spacing was inconsistent. That’s important.\n\nBecause I wasn’t alone down there. Or at least—I hadn’t been.\n\n**SUB-3 ACCESS**\n\nI followed the prints.\n\nThey moved away from the main line and stopped at the **Sub-3 Access door**. Which is supposed to be sealed.\n\nIt still is, physically. But something had changed.\n\nThere was condensation on the panel—just a trace, like a breath held too long. The seal ring had faint smudging around the perimeter. And there was a scent, almost buried under the bleach: something organic. Warm. Slightly sweet. Not rot. Not blood. But *cellular.* Like the inside of someone’s palm.\n\nThe prints stopped there. No exit trail. Which suggests the door opened and closed again after.\n\nI tapped my fob against the reader. Denied, as expected. Status: RED. No override available. I backed away, drew a boundary mark on the floor with chalk from my kit, and logged the contact time: 03:11.\n\nTurned to leave.\n\nThat’s when I saw it.\n\n**THE BADGE**\n\nHalf-tucked under the lip of a vent just past the Z-3/Utility junction was a **personnel badge**.\n\nLaminated. Scuffed. Coiled black cord twisted behind it like someone had balled it up in a pocket.\n\nIt was positioned **deliberately**, half-visible, as if left to be found.\n\nHere’s what I recorded:\n\n* Name field: **Blank.**\n* Photo field: **Fully blacked out.** Not blurred. Cross-hatched in black marker. Thick strokes. Ink bled through the plastic.\n* ID Number: M3–170–614. Cross-referenced the prefix: **Medical Research, Tier 3.** No active employees with that designation listed since the original onboarding manifest was posted in briefing.\n* Laminate condition: warped, corners curled from prolonged exposure to heat.\n* Clipped to the edge of a bent vent grate, which shows no signs of forced entry.\n\nThe badge was warm to the touch.\n\nI’m not exaggerating. I touched it with a gloved hand and felt heat through the material. Surface temp was above room temperature. I checked ambient hallway air: 65°F. The badge? Closer to 90°F. I didn’t have a thermal scanner, but I’ve carried warm gear long enough to know body heat when I feel it.\n\nAnd here’s what really rattled me:\n\nThe photo square? The marker had been **applied from the inside.** You could see the strokes under the laminate. The only way to do that is to mark the image *before* it was sealed.\n\nThat means the badge was made like that.\n\nSomeone didn’t want that face seen—not later, not ever.\n\n**THE LIGHTS**\n\nI stood up, pocketed the badge, and that’s when the lights died.\n\nNot a flicker. Not a surge. Not a transition.\n\nA full, **instant blackout**.\n\nI looked at my watch. Analog, no backlight. Tapped it. 03:27. I started counting.\n\nOne…  \nTwo…  \nThree…\n\nNothing moved. No sound. No fallback strobes. Emergency protocol is a red rotary every 20 feet. None activated.\n\n…Four.  \nFive.  \nSix.\n\nI stood still. Baton's in my hand, but it felt like dead weight. Like it didn’t matter.\n\n…Seven.  \nEight.\n\nThe walls weren’t just dark. They were **empty**. The air felt hollow. Like it was watching.\n\n…Nine.\n\nThe lights came back.  \nSnap. Full brightness. Same position. Same orientation. No delay in current. No heat pulse from the LEDs.\n\nI hadn’t moved. Nothing else had either.\n\nBut I checked the prints again. And the wet ones? The ones I’d seen?\n\nThey were gone.\n\n**RETURN TO HUB**\n\nReturned to Security Hub at 03:49. Airlock cycled without delay. Perimeter cameras are back online. Power grid shows no interruption.\n\nBut the hallway footage from 03:00 to 03:30?\n\n**Corrupted.** Just static.  \nEvery other time segment is intact.\n\nChecked my own locker out of instinct. Found nothing missing—except...\n\nMy **original Army dog tag** was gone.\n\nThe one I wear clipped inside the inside flap of my work vest. The one I **never take out.**\n\nInstead, in its place: a rusted chain with no tag attached. Just the ring.\n\nNo one could’ve gotten in. No one should’ve known it was there. No one should’ve known that tag even existed.\n\n**FINAL NOTES**\n\nENTRY: 0300 Patrol – Incident Level: **Anomalous**\n\nFINDINGS:  \n– Unauthorized ID badge recovered.  \n– Hallway lighting failure: exact 9-second blackout.  \n– Sub-3 door showed condensation, unlogged activity.  \n– Wet footprints not matching my pattern.  \n– Audio/visual recording wiped for blackout period.  \n– Personal equipment tampering confirmed.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  \nBadge secured in lockbox. Chain logged. Report sent via encrypted dispatch. Radio channel 4 remains silent. I haven’t tried transmitting. Not yet.\n\nI’m staying awake until 0500. I won’t be doing the next patrol early. If the rules say 2300 and 0300 only, I’m not testing them.\n\nI don’t think this building *wants* you walking outside those windows.\n\nAnd whatever is using the doors… it doesn’t use keys.\n\nNext update after rest cycle.  \nAssuming I sleep.\n\nStandby.",

          "Post Text": "\nChapter 1 \n\n\nI was finally able to fall asleep after cleaning the house, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making dinner, and getting my brothers and sister to bed, not to mention getting my homework done. I have a major paper due tomorrow, and I just finished it. Getting it done with three three-year-old toddlers running around is not the easiest thing to do. I had just finally fallen into a deep slumber when I was ripped out of bed and dragged down the stairs. Damn that is going to leave a mark or two. “What the fuck is this shit?” My mother yelled at me. “Your father will be home soon, get this shit cleaned up!” She shouted, throwing me in the kitchen. “First of all, you made this mess, I had everything spotless, so you need to clean up after yourself and secondly, he’s NOT my FATHER!” I spat back. My mother reared back and slapped me so hard that she drew blood and making me fall back to the floor. I shook my head slightly trying to get my bearings back. “He IS your FATHER! Now get this shit cleaned up before he gets home.” She shrieked at and stormed out of the kitchen to her room. This isn’t the first time she has done this; she would come home and make a mess and tell him that I didn’t do any of my chores. My mom’s not as bad as he can be, he can be downright evil. He beat me so badly once that I could hardly move and of course that meant I couldn’t clean, cook, or take care of the triplets and that made things worse, and it led to another beating. I had to force myself up to get things done. Eventually I fell into a routine and was able to get everything done, even on the days when my mom came home in a bitchy mood.\n\n\n\nI was in the middle of cleaning up the mess my mom made when HE walked into the kitchen. “What is this shit? Why is nothing clean!” I heard him bellow. I was already pissed at mom, so this was not going to be good for me in the end. “It was clean until your wife got home and decided that her day wasn’t complete until she made mine into shit!” I spat; my words laced with venom. “What did you say?!” He snarled. I saw his eyes shift back and forth between his brown color to pitch black. He always did that when he got angry. “You heard me; I didn’t stutter.” I yelled at him as I finished cleaning up after my mom. “Don’t you ever speak about your mother like that!” He yelled, the next thing I knew pain was shooting down my neck. I fell to my knees grabbing the back of my head. I tried to stand but his fist cracked against the right side of my face. “You will show us some respect!” He growled out standing over me. “I told you he wouldn’t be happy.” Mom sneered. “C’mon Freddy dear, I’m tired, it’s been a long day.” She told him rubbing herself against him, that is so gross. He pulled her to his chest as she purred in his arms. She gave him her, what she calls, her sexy smile and walked out of the kitchen, swaying her hips. “I better not find any blood here in the morning. You understand?” He yelled. I didn’t answer so he repeated himself and he hated to repeat himself. “DO. YOU. UNDERSTAND.” He gritted out. “DO NOT MAKE ME REPEAT MYSELF.” He growled as he towered over me, and I nodded my head.\n\n\n\nOnce I was finally finished cleaning the kitchen, again, I went to bed, praying I could get a few hours of sleep before my alarm went off. My alarm clock went off at five a.m., I groaned and shut it off. I went to my bathroom as quietly as I could since the triplets slept in my room. I did my business, showered, brushed my teeth, and got started on trying to hide the bruises on my face. They were a little darker than usual, so I wasn’t able to cover them all the way. I did the best I could. I walked out of the bathroom to find my little ones wide awake and sitting quietly waiting for me. Fred has them trained and so scared not to cry, yell, or throw temper tantrums. He beat me in front of them when they misbehaved and told them that if they keep it up, he will do the same thing to them. It only took for them to see him beat me once and they never made a peep again. I would take a beating for them anytime; the slightest squeal of joy would throw both of into a fit of rage. Imagine that the squeal of happiness from their children makes them angry.\n\n\n\n“Stowme.” I heard Ryder call out softly. “Good morning my little loves. Did you sleep well?” I asked, helping them from their bed and placed them on the floor. They nodded their heads with yawns. “C’mon, we need to get you cleaned up and outta your jammies.” I told them as they waddled to the bathroom. Nancy never took care of them, except for the first six months after they were born she was a good mom and I thought that maybe she would change but when they turned six-month-old, she started back to work and would stay out late. Fred moved their stuff into my room and told me that they are now my problem and responsibility and that they are my kids now. By the time I got the four of us ready it was six thirty. I took them downstairs, packed their snack bags, their sippy cups, grabbed our backpacks and quietly made our way out the door. Fred and Nancy were still asleep, they slept until whenever they decided to get up. They both worked in the evening until sometime in the early morning hours, it usually worked out because we hardly ever had to see each other, unless Nancy was in one of her moods or I accidentally came face to face with one of them.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nMy first class started at eight fifteen, giving me a little over an hour to drop them off at daycare, which was on campus, run by the child development department. Since I didn’t have money to pay I explained my situation to them, well except the beatings. They were able to find a scholarship to help pay for the triplets fees, they even offered me a job to help me make some money to take care of my siblings. “Good morning, Stormie.” Mrs. Black, the director of the center, greeted. “Morning.” I chirped back. “Mowny.” The triplets greeted in unison. “Why good morning little ones. Are you ready to get your day started?” She asked them, bending down to their level. “Yesh ma’am.” They smiled. “Well come along, you can help me get things ready. Get your bags and say goodbye to mom.” They walked over to me, who they call mama, I put their backpacks on them, and they each gave me a hug and kiss and waddled off with Mrs. Black. Mrs. Black turned to me and mouthed, See ya later. I waved at Mrs. Black and made my way out. The weather was starting to change, it was getting cooler, the leaves were changing colors and that means winter break is around the corner. I hate winter break; the beatings always got worse.\n\n\n\n“Hi, what would you like?” The girl behind the counter asked with boredom. “A large hot mocha please.” I was digging through my bag looking for my wallet when the girl said, “four dollars and twenty-five cents, please.” She huffed at me. “Sorry, sorry, sorry, I have my wallet in here somewhere.” I smiled at her. “Look lady, if you can’t pay, why did you order?” “I can pay, I just can’t find my wallet.” “You’re holding up the line.” She snapped. I turned around and saw that there were six people behind me. “C’mon lady, hurry up!” Someone grunted. “Yeah, we’re gonna be late for class.” I blushed in embarrassment. “Sorry,” I said one more time and ran out. I couldn’t help it, but I started crying. As I was hurrying out, I bumped into a wall, well it felt like a wall, but it turned out to be a person a very HUGE person, a male person. I bumped into him so hard that we both dropped our things. I quickly picked up my things. “I’m so sorry.” I muttered looking at the stranger. We made eye contact and wholly shitzu, I felt like I was hit by a lightning bolt. Who is this Greek God looking back at me? He has the deepest gray eyes, shoulder length black hair and his lips, his oh so plump kissable lips. What is wrong with me? I don’t even know him, and my lower region is on fire. I heard him say, “MATE - MINE.” I gave him a confused look and then he shook his head lightly. “Are you okay?” His voice sent chills down my spine. “Umm…Yeah, I’m fine.” I answered him softly as he extended his hand to help me up. I reluctantly put my hand in his. I had no idea what happened, but I felt jolts of electricity flow through my body. He felt it also because he inhaled sharply. I pulled my hand away from his and thought I heard a low growl from him. The way he looked at me made me wish I had a change of panties. “Uh, again, sorry. I need to go. I’m gonna be late for class.” I said backing away from him. I wasn’t anywhere from being late for class, I still had at least an hour, but I couldn’t chance letting him get any ideas that I was interested in him, even though I wouldn’t mind climbing that mountain. He opened his mouth to say something, but I turned tail and ran off. What did he mean by saying, MATE MINE? I knew I could never belong to anyone, except of course to Fred, he would never let me go. Although I’m sure my mom wouldn’t mind, she wouldn’t miss us, she would be free to live her life like she wants, not that she doesn’t already. \n\n\n\nI was deep in thought when I heard someone clear their throat and ask, “Are you okay?” I looked up and saw a pretty blue eyed, perky blonde smiling at me. “Yeah, I’m fine.” I didn’t even realize I was on the ground. I grumbled in embarrassment. “It happens, here let me help you up.” She said, extending her hand. “Oh my! What happened to your face? Did someone here hurt you?” She gasped. “What?! Oooh, nothing. I’m just very clumsy, as you can see, I wasn’t paying attention and got hit by a door.” I tried to explain but the look on her face told her that she didn’t believe me. “If you’ll excuse me…\"\" I started to say. “Here, try this.” She said handing me a bottle of cover up. “C’mon, let's see if we can get this covered.” She offered. “Thanks.” I sighed as we walked into the lady’s room, and the girl applied the cover up. “By the way my name is Stormie.” I smiled faintly. “Nice to meet you, Stormie.” She smiled back at me. “I’m Summer SilverMoon, I just transferred, so today is my first day.” She replied, stood back, and admired her work. “There all covered up.” She turned me to look in the mirror. “Whoa!” I gasped. Whatever she did, she was able to cover every single bruise and cut. I need to ask her how to do that. “Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I softly said. “No problem. Would you tell me who did this to you?” She asked. I stood there in silence, no one ever asked me about my bruises. They always walked by and ignored me. “I know we just met but if you ask for help, I can help you.” Summer offered. I wanted to ask for help, but I was scared. I knew that Fred would never let me go, he would follow me to the end of the world if he had to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nWhen Summer realized that I wasn’t going to answer her she changed the subject. “So, what class are you going to? Ethics with Mr. Sheridan.” “Hey me too!” She said with excitement. “But he’s not the instructor anymore.” She said as we walked into the classroom. “What? He’s been teaching since the semester started.” I frowned. “Yeah, rumor is that he was in a car accident over the weekend, so there’s a new instructor.” She explained. How did I not know this? I asked myself. Oh yeah, three 3-year-old little terrors, my little terrors. I have no time for anything else outside of them, right now, they are my life. We walked into the classroom, and I started making my way to my normal seat at the top of the room. Summer tugged at my arm and led me to the second-row corner seats. I shook my head no. I didn’t like sitting so close, it was easier for me to stay invisible, especially when I had bruises to hide. “Summer, I’m gonna go sit up there, these seats are just too close to the front.” I said pointing to my regular seat and lowering my head. “No, please sit with me. I can’t see the board from way up there and you’re the only person I know.” Summer pouted. I groaned, I hate pouting, the triplets do it all the time, Summer reminded me of them. “Don’t pout!” I groaned at her. She kept her pout going and gave puppy dog eyes. “Uuggg…fine, okay.” I grumbled and Summer squealed in delight. I shook my head and settled into my seat as the rest of the class started making their way in. I got a few glances and stares, but I just kept my head down and chatted with Summer.\n\n\n\n“Oh, my Goddess!” A shrill voice came from behind us. Have you seen our new instructor?! She excitedly asked her friend. I rolled my eyes. “I got a peek at him and the other guy as I passed by his office on my way here.” She smirked. “They are both beyond hot and they don’t even look that much older than us. I am so going to love getting into his pants.” She smirked as she adjusted her boobs. “Such whores.” Summer snorted and I snorted out a laugh. “Excuse you! No one was talking to you or asked for your opinion. You and the invisible girl need to mind your own business.” She spit back at us. “I can say whatever I want.” “You’re the one telling the whole class what you’re THINKING will happen. I’m not here to listen to your wanna be conquests. This is not a dating service; this is a place of higher education. If you’re just here to find your mate, then I think you’re in the wrong place.” Summer coolly said. Wait?! Did Summer just say mate? This is the second time I’ve heard that word MATE, is it like the Australian people use the word MATE. I’ll have to remember to ask her about that later. “Oh puh-lease, you’re just jealous.” The girl said looking at her manicured fingers. “We can get any guy we want anytime we want.” She bragged. Summer snorted so hard that she blew her coffee out her nose. “Me jealous? Of you?” Summer snorted wiping her face. Storm couldn’t help but laugh at the whole situation and when she finally got herself together she said, “Yeah sure, keep telling yourself that Barbie doll. The only guys you will get are little boys, not MEN.” Summer said.\n\n\n\nI was still giggling when the most amazing scent hit my nose, sandalwood, and fresh cut grass. A small, low whimper escaped my lips, OH DAMN. I hoped that no one heard that. I looked towards the door where the scent was coming from. Oh, my dear heavenly skittles, it’s him, the Greek God I bumped into this morning. He lifted his nose like he is sniffing the air and looked around, his eyes shifted to pitch black as we locked eyes. We stared at each other for a few seconds before he broke eye contact licking his bottom lip. All I could feel was a shiver run down my spine. Why didn’t his scent hit me earlier? I have no idea what’s going on but whatever it is, I can’t… let myself have feelings for anyone. Fred will kill him and me. “Hey. you, okay?” Summer nudged me. “Huh? Yeah, I’m good.” I said, feeling my face blush. “Looks like someone has the hots for the teacher.” Summer sniggered. The girl behind us leaned into my ear and said, “don’t even think about it, he’s mine. Besides, why would he want a nobody like you? He’s not gonna want to be stuck with a single mom with three little monsters.” I could feel my anger rising, my jaw clenched, and my hands balled into tight fists. I was ready to beat the shit outta this skank, she needs to stay away from him. Before I could do anything else, I felt a presence next to me. “Is there a problem, ladies?” He asked in his smooth and husky voice, for some reason, just the sound of his voice helped calm and soothe me. How is that even possible? “No, no problem prof.” Summer commented glaring at the girls behind her. “Well, please be respectful in my class ladies. This classroom will be treated as a professional work atmosphere just as if you are in an actual business setting.” He said but more to the skanks sitting behind us. “I would hate to hafta treat you like children but I’m going to ask you two to take seats on the other side of the room.” I started to gather my things. “No, not you two but the two behind you.” He said motioning to the skanks. “What?! Why?!” Skank number one asked with surprise. “But, but…” She stammered out. “Please, go take your new seats, we need to get class started. And those will be your regular seats from now on.” He announced. “The seats you are in will be your assigned seats and the person to your right will be your assigned partner. If no one is sitting next to you or you don’t have a partner by the end of class, see me during my office hours.” He said as he made his way down to the podium. “We’ve never had assigned seats!” Skank one grumbled. “Well, this is my class now, and I assign seats.” He told her raising an eyebrow at her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\nSummer chuckled and sent a small wave bye to them. I took my seat, and I could feel him watching me from the corner of his eye. I would steal a few glances at him and the last time I did, he caught me, he smiled and threw a quick wink at me. Oh, cheese and crackers, my panties are in trouble. I can’t let this happen! Fred would kill me; he’s never going to let me go. He’s already told me, that’s why I’ve NEVER been on a date. I don’t even want to think about what would happen, who would take care of the triplets. I have to stay away from him, somehow. I just don’t know how or if I can do that, I’m drawn to him, but I have no idea why? He started his lecture, but I wasn’t really listening, I’m glad that I had a small recorder set up. I was so caught up in my own thoughts, the what if’s, the can not’s, the why can’t my life be different, why couldn’t I have a normal family life. Am I ever going to be happy? Am I ever going to fall in love and have a family of my own? What about my siblings, will they grow up happy? Or will they be condemned to a life of hell with Fred and our mom.\n\n\n\nYeah, some mother she is. After my dad died, she lost it. I was ten when my dad died, my world fell apart and I thought that my mom and me would get through it together, but she would go out and be gone for hours and then eventually she’d be gone for days at a time. I knew right then and there that I was on my own. Nancy packed us up the day after dad’s funeral and we moved to some decrepit house across the country so, I had no other family to turn to, I had to grow up quickly. A few months later mom came home and told me that she’s pregnant and the father of the baby would be living with them. He just had to be near his child and his female, as he called her. Mom was never the same after she got together with Fred, it’s like she was under some spell of his that wouldn’t let her go. We had no idea that she was having triplets until the day they were born. They were squishy little things, but I fell in love with them immediately. They were my family, and I was never going to let anything happen to them.\n\n\n\n“Storm. Hey hello. Earth to Stormie.” I heard Summer as she snapped her fingers in front of my face. “Huh, what?” I said coming out of my daze. “Where did you go?” She chuckled. “Sorry. Just getting lost in my own thoughts.” I shrugged. “I’ve been told that I’m a pretty good listener.” She says with a comforting smile. “Thanks, but I don’t want to burden you with my problems.” I shrugged my shoulders. “It’s not a bother. It’ll be good to let it all out. If you let it sit and fester, you may end up snapping and then you will be committed, and I would have to break you out and we would be on the run with your three little monsters. Way too much drama so, let’s just grab lunch at the café and talk.” She suggested with a chuckle. I let out a small snort. I know she meant nothing bad when she called the triplets little monsters. “Uh, no, not the café. I had a rather embarrassing moment there.” I scrunch my nose. Summer giggled. “When and where do you not have an embarrassing moment?” She snickered. “Hey.” I laughed, nudging Summer with my elbow. “Excuse me, Miss…” I looked up and low and behold it’s my Greek God. I was at a loss of words, “wholly shitzu! What’s my name? I can’t remember my name!” I heard muffled laughing in the back of mind. After a few seconds, I finally remembered my name and found my voice, maybe. “S-Storm, m-my n-name is S-St-Storm Hawk.” I stuttered out as Summer continued to cover her mouth trying not to laugh at me as I shoot her a death glare. “Well, Storm, please give me a few minutes, I would like to speak with you.” He said, giving me a small smile. I swallowed the big lump that formed in my throat. “Uuumm...o-okay.” I didn’t know what to say, all I wanted to do was run and hide. “Okay then, I will go grab our lunch and meet you in the quad.” Summer said flashing me a mischievous grin, giving me two thumbs up and wiggling her brows. I shook my head and rolled my eyes at her as she made her way out of the room. “Excuse me, Mr.…, I’m sorry I didn’t get your name.” Her shrill voice brought me back to attention making me cringe. “Actually, I don’t think I gave my name.” He said keeping a close eye on me. “Oh, well anyway, I wanted to invite you for a drink to apologize for my earlier behavior.” Skank said, giving me a snide smile. “Actually, I think you owe Ms. Hawk and the rest of the class an apology for your behavior and taking up their class time. Not to mention for calling her children…” he looked at me and squinted “…little monsters. Do you know them? Do you know for a fact that they are little monsters?” He scolded her like I would the triplets. I couldn’t help myself, but I threw a smirk at the skank. I couldn’t believe I just did that; I’ve never done that before; it would usually end up with me being slapped across the face. Fred would definitely punish me if he found out. So as quickly as the smirk appeared, it disappeared.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nBesides she’s just the invisible girl, it’s not like she matters. She’s just a stupid, weak human.” She said standing closer to him rubbing his arm. I don’t know why but there was something in me that made me wanted to rip skanks arms off. I was jealous. No way! How can I be jealous over someone I doesn’t even know? I don’t even know his name. I narrowed my eyes at the skank. I wanted to say something, but I kept my mouth shut. “What’s your name?” He asked the skank sweetly. I want to vomit; this is disgusting. Skank gives him what I assume is supposed to be a seductive smile. “Gwen Lloyd.” Skank said running her finger across her collar bone. Blahhhhhh, I just vomited in my mouth. “Ms. Lloyd, first of all, dating a student is strictly forbidden, so that is going to be a NO to the drink. Second, you need to remove your hand from me, my mate will not appreciate the unwanted touching.” He said removing her hand from his arm. “Why don’t you just reject her and let me be the one to please you in ways she never could. I can drive you wild.” She whispered, well not really whisper because I heard her. She was as quiet as a bullhorn. I wished I hadn’t heard her though, whoever his mate is, she is one lucky girl. I assume, at this point, that mate means girlfriend, boyfriend, significant other. I’m so confused. I have no idea what alternate world I’ve been thrown into.\n\n\n\nI didn’t want to stay and continue to watch this, so I slowly turned and started to walk out of the room. “Ms. Hawk, I need you to stay please. We have a few matters to discuss. Ms. Lloyd, please exit the room and I suggest that you drop this class and perhaps even find a new major that is more suited to your abilities.” Oh, crap! He didn’t just say that. She was angry, I could see it in her eyes. I guess no one has ever spoken to her like that. “How dare you!!” She yelled. “You will pay for this!” She said, slapping him and then stomping out. I wanted to run and soothe the spot she slapped but I had to stop myself. I felt bad, this was, after all, my fault. Now he’s going to get in trouble. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.” I whispered. He gave me a confused look. “You don’t have anything to apologize for, you did nothing wrong, none of this is your fault. Besides, I won’t get in trouble.” He tried to assure me. “I have you as my witness that she was the one who threw herself at me and I politely declined.” He smiled. I shrugged. “Uh…yeah, just let me know if anyone needs to talk to me.” I told him. We were quiet for a few minutes. “Maybe I should go.” I walked to the door, before I could even put my hand on the doorknob, I was swiftly turned to face him and he had me caged in between his arms. He lowered his face to mine, his warm minty breath fanning against my lips. He leaned in close to my ear and I heard him inhale. “Mmmmm, such a sweet scent, vanilla, and honeysuckle.” He whispered as he kissed the flesh in the crook of my neck. I had to bite my bottom lip to keep myself from releasing the moan that had built up. All I could do at this point was fist his shirt in my hands and close my eyes. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t run, not that I wanted to, all this felt so good and so right for some reason. As much as this felt right, I had to get away from him, I can’t get involved with anyone, especially not my instructor. “S-s-sir, p-p-please, l-l-l-let m-me g-g-go.” I was finally able to shutter out. \n\n\n\nBefore I could say anything else, a male voice yelled from the top of the lecture hall, “Blasé, c’mon let’s… Silas, you shit, get out!” My instructor, who I know now, his name is Blasé. This Silas guy came bouncing down the stairs. “Dude…oh shit! Sorry, didn’t know you were giving private tutoring.” He grinned. “Silas! If you don’t get outta here, you’re not walking out of here on your own.” Blasé said sounding angry. He released his grip enough for me to open the door and I high tailed it outta there. “Storm! Wait, please come back.” He shouted at me for me to stop. There was no way I was going to stop. I ran out of there making my way to the quad, I needed to find Summer. “Hey Stormie! Over here.” Summer call out. I made my way over to where she was sitting. “Hey Summer.” I said still trying to catch my breath. “It’s about time, I thought you forgot about me.” She frowned at me. “Sorry, I got held up.” I told her. “I bet you did.” She giggled and winked at me. “Here eat, you look a little pale.” She said handing me my lunch. I took the bag that held a roast beef sandwich, chips, and tea. I was actually pretty hungry; I didn’t get a chance to have breakfast because of my little fiasco this morning. We sat in silence for a while, I was lost in my thoughts over the events of earlier. “How could this be happening? I’m so confused.” I whispered to myself thinking no one could hear me. “How could what happen? What are you confused about Mimi?” She asked looking at me with true concern.\n\n\n\n“Wait? What?” I stared at her. “Did you just call me Mimi?” She shrugged her shoulders. “Yeah. I like it, don’t you?” She asked a little sad. “No one has ever given me a nickname before.” I smiled. “Well, you have one now. So, tell me what happened that had you running here like your ass was on fire?” She asked giving me a warm concerned smile. \n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\nThe skank huffed. “That is not going to happen. I do not apologize to anyone for anything. I took a deep breath. “This is going to sound absolutely crazy but what is a mate?” Her eyes went a little wide. “I heard you mention it earlier and well…” I paused; Summer motioned for me to continue. “I bumped into our instructor this morning when I was running out of the café. When he looked at me, he said, Mate - Mine.” I explained. “And what did you do?” She asked biting into her food. “I freaked out and ran, then you found me on the ground.” I stopped again taking a drink of my tea and then looking around. I wanted to make sure that no one was listening. Summer sat quietly waiting for me to continue. “After you left, Gwen the skank.” I said her name with disgust. “Basically, threw herself at him, it was, she was gross. He told her it was against school policy and that she needed to stop touching him because his mate wouldn’t appreciate her touching him. He told her to leave, find another major. After she left, pretty pissed off, I might add. I tried to leave but he pinned me to the door and he…he sniffed me. He said I smelled like vanilla and honeysuckle and then he started kissing my neck. I finished scrunching my face. I have no idea what is happening, as freaked out as I was, it felt good and so right. Like I’m supposed to be with him, but I have no idea what a mate is, and I have NO idea who he is. He said his mate wouldn’t appreciate her touching him but yet he pinned me to the door and was kissing on me!” I whisper-yelled. “So, how was the kiss?” Summer asked with a huge grin. “Summer!!! That’s all you got outta what I just said?” I scolded her. “Oh, and what the hell is a MATE?” I whispered-yelled glaring at her.\n\n\n\n“Storm!! Get your fat ass over here NOW!” I froze in fear as his familiar voice filled my ears. “Fred? What are you doing here?” I asked him with my eyes wide with fear as he stalked towards me. Summer stood closer to me. “Mimi, are you okay? Who is he?” She asked. “You were supposed to be home for lunch! Did you forget we were having guests over? Do you have any idea the embarrassment you caused your mother having to order take out?” He yelled grabbing my wrist tightly, his nails digging into my skin. I winced in pain. “I left the food in the fridge, all she had to do was put it in the oven for twenty minutes.” I told him trying to free my now bleeding wrist trying not to make eye contact with him. “That wasn’t good enough! Your mother threw it out! She said it wasn’t even worthy of feeding to a wild animal.” He was now holding me by my collar. “That’s not my problem! I made what she asked for, if she wanted something different then she should have made it herself!” I gritted out. I knew the second those words left my mouth, punishment was going to rain down hard on me and of all places, here at school for everyone to see. Next thing I know the side of my face was stinging. I could hear Summer yelling at him. “Get away from her asshole. Don’t touch her again!” She growled as his fist came down on me again and again, I fell to the ground, and he started kicking me in the ribs, stomach and anywhere else he could get to. “Mind your own business bitch or you’ll be next!” He growled at her. “I’d like to see you try and she is my business!” Summer snarled back. “Summer, please stop, it’s okay.” I whimpered to her.\n\n\n\n“GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER!!” I heard someone roar. I tried to crawl away from Fred, but he stomped on my shoulder bring me to a stop as I heard a popping sound. I looked up trying to see what was happening. I heard scuffling, yelps, growls, and grunts. What was going on? I saw Fred thrown to the ground a few feet away from me. He was covered in blood and was a crumpled mess lying next to me. Who did that to him? My vision was starting to blur but I could see a bunch of feet circling around Fred. I just want to curl up in my bed and not come out. “Oh, my Goddess, Mimi. What did he do to you?” Summer gasped. “Blasé! Get over here, NOW!” She yelled out. Why is she calling for him? How does she know his name? Does she know him? “My head is killing me.” I mumbled. I tried to get up. “I have to get my little ones. They’re going to be so worried about me.” I said but I felt myself stumble and before I hit the ground again, a pair of warm arms caught me. I could feel sparks where his fingers touched me. I couldn’t help but nuzzle closer to him. “It’s okay my love. I got you. You’re safe. He will never hurt you again, no one will hurt you.” He whispered. Before I faded into darkness, I said, “Triplets.”\n\n\n\n“Triplets?” I repeated looking at Summer. “That’s right, that skank referred to some little monsters.” Summer said turning towards me. “She has kids. Three of them?” I said out loud cradling her in my arms. “Summer go check the day care, maybe they go there. If so, take them back to the pack house, maybe they’ll know what’s going on and what happened to their mom.” Summer nodded and sprinted to the daycare center. “Blasé, what do we do with him? The human authorities are leaving him to us.” Silas informed. “Take him to the cells, have doc ready also, see what you can find out about my mate and her family.” I ordered him getting into the back seat of my car still holding my mate. Yes, I have personal driver. “Robbie, get us back to the pack house quickly.” I demanded. “You got it boss.” He quickly but carefully got us to the pack hospital.\n\n\n\n“Alpha, this way, I have a room ready for her.” The doctor in charge stated. I followed the doctor into one of the private rooms. \n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n“What happened to her?” The doc asked examining Storm. “She has bruises upon bruises!” She exclaimed. “Poor child who would do this to her?” She looked at me with tears in her eyes. “It was her so-called father.” I told her grinding my teeth. I felt the doctor put her hand on my shoulder. “She’ll be okay. I’ll run some tests, get some scans, give her fluids, pain medicine, some antibiotics and let her rest; she must be a strong one for her to endure all these injuries.” She tried to assure me. “Blasé, I have the triplets.” Summer mind linked. “They are scared and are crying for Storm. Also, she’s their sister not mom. She’s the one who has cares for them, her mom and Fred, well I think you can figure it out.” She sighed. “Where are you?” I asked. “I need to make sure they’re okay, siblings or kids, it’s all the same to me, I will protect her and them. They are my family now. I’ll be there in a few minutes.” I told her. I looked over at my still sleeping, well, unconscious mate. How could anyone treat her like this. I could feel the anger and rage build. I moved closer to her, kneeled down, and inhaled her scent, her scent calmed me and my beast. “Blasé, son.” My mom’s voice sounded in the room. She was standing next to me with a frown on her face. My mom is the best, she’s always been there for me and my siblings, the twins, Silas, and Summer. “Son, you need to come to the house and eat.” She softly said. “You’ve been here for over four hours; her little ones are so worried about her.” “I can’t leave her mom. Every time I try to get up to leave, my legs get heavy and won’t move. She needs me. She doesn’t even know me mom! He never presented her to the pack! I don’t even know how long she’s been here.” I growled. “She does need you and always will, but you need to keep your strength up or you won’t be any good to her or those cute little pups of hers.” She smiled as she said the last part. “You met them?” I looked up at her. “Yes, they are such sweet little angels. They are also very worried about her, she’s very important to them. It seems that her love is all they’ve ever had. You should spend some time with them, they could use your assurance.” She said patting my shoulder. \n\n\n\n“As soon as the doctor comes back with news, I’ll go check on them.” She kissed the top of my head and left me alone with my mate. I traced my fingers along her jawline, gently rubbing each black and blue mark on her face with each touch, sparks tickled the tips of my fingers. I think she felt the sparks also because her heart rate would spike a little bit and she would softly sigh. “Alpha.” The doctor called getting my attention. “What did you find?” I was able to croak out. She sighed. “She has a lot of healed fractures; her ribs have been broken on several occasions. She also has a small fracture along her left cheek, I may have to wire it shut for a week or so. I will need to keep an eye on it and see how it looks over the next day or two. Hopefully it should heal with no problem just make sure on one hit’s her again.” I snorted. “No one will ever touch her like that again!” I growled. “I know, please try to stay calm. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…” He started to say. “It’s okay. I understand.” She smiled at me. “How long does she need to stay here?” I asked still watching my mate. “As soon as she wakes, I want to make sure there are no other unseen issues.” She advised. “Alpha, you should go eat and get some rest. I’ll call you if there are changes.” Dr. Reese told me. “The second she opens her eyes, no matter what time or what I am doing.” I demanded of her. “Of course.” She agreed. \n\n\n\n“I’ll also need for you to check her three siblings.” “Where are they?” “They are at the pack house, my mom has been looking after them, so you’ll need to get by her.” I chuckled. “Oh dear.” She mumbled to herself. “I’ll bring them by to visit there sister and you can give them a checkup then.” I suggested to her. “Thank you, that will work.” She said a little relieved. “Mom is very protective of those she considers her babies and I think these three new little ones are falling into that category.” I sighed and rubbed my face. I want her with me, by my side, in my bed, our bed. I’ve been searching for her since I was sixteen. “Father must die for hurting little mate!” My wolf grumbled. “I will deal with him.” I told him. My wolf was ready to tear Fred apart earlier, if Summer hadn’t called me over, Fred would be dead. “He should be dead.” My wolf growled at me. I leaned down and placed a kiss on her cheek. “I’ll be back later, my love. I promise. I’m going to go check on our pups, they’re worried about you. You need to come back to them, to me, please. I’ve finally found you; I can’t lose you the same day I found you.” I whispered in her ear. I felt her shiver a little. I smiled and kissed her again before I walked out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I've been browsing SS and City24 but have only seen pets mentioned once or twice (and that was to say they weren't allowed).\n\n2. We're moving from abroad and will have to rent something quickly and without knowing a lot about neighborhoods and how things work. If a place ends up not working out for us, how hard is it to get out of a lease? We're going to try hard to find a suitable place the first time, but we're worried we'll be stuck for a year somewhere we won't like. We can afford to lose a deposit, but don't want to have problems renting in the future.\n\n3. Do you need to provide proof of income? We won't have jobs yet, but have plenty in savings. \n\n4. Any recommendations for neighborhoods? We know Centr and Old Town are loud and popular, but being close to things to do is a plus. We're going to be doing things like language classes, taking our kid to preschool, museums, going to the gym, concerts, playgrounds and parks, and trying to make local friends. We'll be working from home initially, or maybe a co-working space if there's any around. We really like green space, but are afraid that if we get too far from the city center it'll be too much of a hassle to do anything. An easy time getting to the beach would also be a plus.\n\nOne last unrelated question: how difficult is it to find gluten free food in Riga? One of us has some dietary issues, so we're curious how that'll be.\n\nLiels paldies!\n\n",

Jeg har svært ved at vurdere, hvad der er relevant at tage med, og hvad jeg egentligt gerne vil spørge om. Dog håber jeg, at der er nogle der har lyst til at læse mit skriv og eventuelt fortælle mig, hvad I tænker. \n\nPt bor og læser jeg på universitet i Aalborg. Jeg synes det er okay både at bo og læse her, men er kommet meget i tvivl om hvorvidt det giver mening for mig at fortsætte. Jeg har en kæreste der bor i Vejle. Jeg synes vi er kommet dertil, hvor det ville give god mening at bo sammen, hvilket jeg også har meget lyst til. \n\nMin tvivl angående studiet, tror jeg, er opstået da jeg synes det er svært. Jeg har lige færdiggjort 2 semester, og jeg synes der er lang vej igen. Både hvis jeg kun vælger at tage bacheloren, og så især hvis jeg vil læse kandidaten efterfølgende. Jeg valgte at gå på universitetet, da jeg nok altid har set mig selv gå den vej, men nu er jeg virkelig i tvivl. Jeg har til tider utroligt meget lyst til at droppe ud og finde mig en trainee plads et sted i Vejle. Det synes jeg dog også kan virke meget angstprovokerende, da jeg føler man så er meget låst fast på hvad end man arbejder med, og jeg reelt set ikke ved endnu, hvilken slags trainee der ville passe til mig + jeg ved heller ikke helt, hvordan jeg ville skulle finde ud af dette. Jeg føler min uddannelse giver mig flere muligheder. Dog kan det også gøre mig nervøs for, at det så bliver svært, når jeg skal ud på arbejdsmarkedet, da jeg netop ikke er oplært i noget konkret. \n\nUniversitet har derudover også altid sagt mig mest, da min uddannelse er kendt for at give gode penge,  når man kommer ud og får sig et job. Jeg tror, at jeg er nervøs for, at en trainee ikke vil kunne give mig mulighed for at få en god løn, og jeg ville være så ked at, at føle jeg skulle nøjes senere i livet. \n\nEr der eventuelt nogle af jer, der nogensinde har haft lignende tanker/overvejelser? Skal jeg hænge i, færdiggøre min bachelor og så eventuelt se derefter? Skal jeg følge mit hjerte og flytte sammen med min kæreste og finde en trainee? Jeg tror mit helt store problem er angsten for at fejle og fortryde uanset hvad jeg gør. Jeg er generelt SÅ bange for, både at blive set som en fiasko, men også at spilde min tid - på den ene eller anden måde...   \n",

I started with a **pure Dex dual Uchi Samurai** for the classic nimble melee style, but wanted something *flashier* and more magical, so I’ve recently transitioned into a **Carian Spellblade battlemage** of sorts around level 90.\n\nIt’s been super fun pulling off stylish moves with things like **Carian Slicer, Greatblade Phalanx, Loretta’s Slash**, etc. But as a newer player, I’ve hit a few snags and would love advice from more experienced spellbladers or hybrid casters. Here's what I’m dealing with:\n\n* **Running out of FP**\n   * Bosses go down fast when I’m spamming spells or weapon arts, but I’m burning through flasks really quickly.\n   * Should I go 50/50 Flask split for HP/FP? Is it better to avoid casting on regular mobs and just melee them?\n   * Are there talismans or gear I’m missing that help with FP efficiency or regen?\n* **Mobility issues &amp; missed spells**\n   * A lot of my spells (especially Carian ones) take time to cast and tend to miss against fast or mobile enemies like wolves, dogs, and horseback knights.\n   * Any suggestions for more *reliable/instant* spells for dealing with groups or moving targets?\n* **Damage feels a bit lacking**\n   * Could be a level issue or my stat allocation (coming from Samurai means I may not have the best base INT).\n   * Any good weapons or upgrades I should chase to help scale better into the battlemage identity?\n* **Spell cycling stress**\n   * I’m carrying too many spells, and in the heat of battle, trying to find the right one feels clunky.\n   * Should I reduce how many I memorize? How do you organize your slots for fast access without screwing up rotations?\n* **Best Spirit Ash for a spellblade?**\n   * Looking for something that complements a hybrid caster/melee playstyle.\n\n**Any general build tips appreciated as well**, especially things like talisman synergy, must-have Ashes of War for spellblades, or even fashion that looks cool with a magical knight aesthetic",

          "Post Text": "We just lost our beloved dog, Phoebe, almost 7 hours ago. She's only 4 and had a liver failure. we/i only found out when she's already in the end stage, meaning that she's been suffering for days.\n\nDuring the early stages, my parents noticed that she's always hiding when my 1 month old niece came in to stay. The hiding occurred for weeks (she does this when someone new stays. It happened once when we brought a new puppy which soon died from an unknown cause) until she suddenly gets sick. She suddenly lost appetite and went to hiding more. Phoebe usually heads out of hiding when she hears signs of dinner time. My parents, having much focus on my niece, wasn't taking phoebe's early stages of symptoms seriously. There was this time where they saw phoebe's urine having small hints of blood. They blamed her for not drinking enough water. so what happened next is that my mother bought her this Dextrose powder for whatever reason that may help with, ignoring the signs of her having an internal problem that will slowly grow into a serious one.\n\na few days later, around 8pm, my mother called me out of my room to hold phoebe while she feeds her the dextrose thing, we noticed that her breath/mouth is smelling unpleasant(the effect of her having gum ulcer), her tummy/skin turning yellowish, and the white part of her eyes also turning yellowish. it's that time where we found out that she's having an organ failure.\n\nI told my mother that it's time to send her to the vets, but that time, it was sunday night, she has to go to work as a teacher tomorrow. so what she did was to ask my sister, the mother of my niece, to head to the last veterinary clinic they went to and ask if they're available for walk-ins (OF COURSE THEY ARE!) but it clearly didn't happen. My sister and her husband went out somewhere else the day after that night(monday).\n\nfast forward to what happend during monday. My parents found Phoebe's vomit under their bed, emitting the smell of phoebe's mouth. My father had enough and told us that \"there's no more hope for that dog\" leashing her at our 2nd floor (the rooftop) to prevent anymore mess inside the house. I went upstairs to check up on her, gave her a few pets before heading back down to my room and cry about it because i couldnt do anything about it.\n\nThe next day, Tuesday morning, the day of her passing. Everyone left the house, leaving me and Phoebe who's still leashed upstairs. I saw her, very fatigued, lying on the concrete floor. At that time, I know that her time is running out but still have enough hope in trying to save her out of her misery. so, i decided to sit and hangout with phoebe, petting her while using an AI app to do research about her sick, how critical is her condition etc. to the point that i started crying.\n\nLater on, i went down stairs to go do something, and then the moment i came back up, phoebe had been on a bowel movement while still lying down conscious, indicating that some of her organs are shutting down. I messaged my mother on what happened and begged her to send immediately phoebe out for euthanasia. She refused. she told me that \"she's already so weak, she'll eventually die\" telling me that i SHOULD just wait until she passes away. At this moment, I lost every hope i had. I became the only advocate who tried to save her from the slow and agonizing pain she's having.\n\nfew minutes later, i went back up after checking on something downstairs and i saw her, finally at rest. Tears fell as i pet her warm head one last time. I was so sad that i wasn't there at her last breath.   \n  \ni announced her death to my mother through messaging, receiving a sad reaction before telling me to put her in a rice sack and then we'll plan on her burial when she gets home.\n\nBefore putting Phoebe in the sack, i rapped her with her favorite towel, the towel we used every time we bathe her and also the one who she loves to chew on. Not just that, she also loved playing tug-of-war with it.\n\n2 and a half hours later, My mother arrived. We had a bit of a struggle to think of where we should burry her until my grandmother stepped in to recommend a nearby spot costing a fair amount of price for someone to dig a grave in.\n\nBefore i head to the place, carried the sack, my mother told me to pray for her, which warmed my heart that there's still a bit of sympathy in her from the passing of phoebe.\n\nIt was a rainy afternoon. I placed the sack containing phoebe in it, down the grave and the  guy who dug it began filling it up. The guy told me that this place is a known pet grave as some people also burried theirs in here. \n\nafter filling it up, i couldn't pray because this place is somebody's property and they can see me from their window. So what i did was walk away through the rain. I began praying for my sorrow, regret, and wish for phoebe. It was a long walk until i got back home, finishing it with an \"Amen\".\n\nPhoebe is a sweet dog. never broke our hearts until her last moment. I couldn't imagine how bad her internal pain was. her fighting as strong as she could to live another hour shows how much time she had to be saved. She was just starting her life in her prime and could have lived more and more years if it wasn't for everyone's neglect.\n\nIt's been 7 hours now as of i'm typing this and I miss her. Fly High, Phoebe. You will always live rent free from the bottom of my heart. \n\nThank you. Sorry. and Goodbye.",

She’s a certified dog trainer and spent years putting this together so new dog owners wouldn’t have to drop hundreds on classes.\n\nMost puppy preschool classes are like $150+ and only cover the basics (sit, stay, etc). And private trainers? Usually $100+ per hour. This course goes way beyond that. It teaches obedience, behavior correction, advanced tricks, and more, but you can do it all at home, at your own pace.\n\nWhat’s cool is she’s super hands on even though it’s an online course. If you're stuck on something or your pup's not getting it, you can literally send her a video or message and she’ll help you work through it, kinda like having a private trainer in your pocket.\n\nNot sure if posts like this are allowed, but figured it might help anyone bringing home a new pup soon 🙂\n\nHere's the link to check it out - [brainycanines.com](http://brainycanines.com)",

I’ll be honest that it has not been turned on for 3 years. I have 0 interest in turning it on and using it. I saw a check list that in the summer that the flue should be closed to not let your A/C out. That makes sense.\n\nSo I closed it and went to work. I’m now at work and panicking after reading more that gas ones shouldn’t be closed? After googling and trying to research for hours, I’m at a loss. Should I go home and re open it up? I have a dog at home. \n\nThe gas part has been off and not turned on for years. I currently do not have pictures, but plan to take pictures this evening and try to find out the make and model to understand it better. Do you think it’s ok and safe? The flue doesn’t have a dampener? So who knows if the previous home owners had it installed correctly or anything of the sort. Overthinking and just want to make sure to be safe.. \n\nThank you for your help!",

The injuries JOK suffered are simply not from being struck by a vehicle — yet there are many people out there (I’m seeing on social media) and in the media (Court TV) who think we are fools for believing it was a set up. I always go back to the injuries and no matter how difficult it is to believe it was a set up, to me the injuries are irrefutable. JOK got into a fight and was also attacked by a dog. Period. I don’t understand why the naysayers don’t see it. \n\nThe woman in the WI case was acquitted in just 4 hours. I believe she knew she at least clipped her husband but did not realize she fatally injured him. Her husband was frozen by morning in similar temps  as it was in Canton — yet JOK was still alive when he was discovered after being outside nearly as long as John Philips in the WI case (with JOK being in the snow about an hour less) — essentially proof JOK was not in the snow all night. \n\nI’m hoping we will someday know what actually happened to JOK — I suspect the truth will be far simpler and with less involvement from others than we may think and certainly than Brian Albert suggested. \n",

          "Post Text": "# Chapter 1 Nightmare “AHHH.” A deep groan broke from the Night Stalker Club office as I passed by.\n\nFucktastic! A loud thud followed, vibrating the door. This was fucking ridiculous. Call me old-fashioned, but they could do it at home before they came over. I quickened my pace toward the entrance of the rooftop. Sex noise didn’t surprise me, but considering my friends were the ones making those noises, it was awkward. I couldn’t listen to that. I couldn’t blame them if they wanted a quick fuck with their wives though. They had the best lives, but ignoring the stabbing pain settling in my chest was hard. At the rooftop, the sun just sat down from the horizon. My eyes were steady as I watched the red, orange, and yellow colors before the twilight beckoning the sky. Those colors reminded me of fire, passion, danger, energy, happiness, and hope. I leaned my elbows against the concrete parapet, flicked the ash from my cigarette, and breathed in the remaining inch I lit up while watching for the sun to set. The lights started to scintillate around me to somehow light up the darkness surrounding the city. I stubbed the butt till it stopped smoking. Exhaust and city pollution came back to life.\n\nI knew people said cigarette smoking was dangerous to your health, but this thing was a reminder that life wasn’t fair. People thought I was a weird shit to choose a deadly companion than a woman—that I didn’t have a beating organ in my body, that I was an ice king if that even existed. What they didn’t know was, I was a good guy, that I didn’t even like this another part of me, but it grew inside me already, and I had to embrace it for some reason.\n\nThe thing was, hard life taught me to be prepared.\n\nThe only question was, would I ever want to be that person anymore? The old version of myself—when I felt I was a better version of who I was today?\n\nI walked down and met the nightclub manager, Kyland in the locker room. I quickly cleared my mind and pretended I didn’t hear what happened earlier.\n\n“Bro.” He patted my back.\n\n“Hey.” I wore my black button-down shirt and rolled each sleeve above my elbows. My tattoo peeked out. It was an orange flame full of anger with black smoke swirled from my wrists up to my arms.\n\n“How’s your trip?”\n\n“Great. Thanks for arranging my sched.”\n\n“Anytime.”\n\n“Got to go to work. Bills won’t pay itself.” I wore my black apron with the club logo and walked out.\n\nThe former notorious playboy, Pyke Hughes, the club owner didn’t give a damn about the uniform. I was glad he preferred black.\n\nThe main bar had its dimly-lit dived with only yellow lights emblazoned from the low ceiling. Monday was not the busiest, but the customers entered in somewhat rush as soon as the club sign lit open.\n\nThe music visualizer from the 3D walls created colorful particles in balls shaped that synchronized to the beat of the 90’s pop song played by the DJ from the booth towering the dance floor.\n\nThe lady in a black dress ordered a dry martini, taking a seat on the dark barstool. Her makeup was simple as if she just came from long hours of work. She tapped her colorless perfectly manicured nails\n\nagainst the bar counter leisurely. Based on her dress, she didn’t come here to flirt and walk out with a man wrapping around her slender waist and have a wild night, but she was waiting for someone to arrive. Perhaps a friend.\n\nI grabbed the cocktail shaker, filling it with ice, gin, and vermouth I took from the back bar. I stirred it for a few seconds. Placing down the martini glass on the counter, I strained the mix and garnished it with olives. “Here you go, ma’am.”\n\nShe gave me a polite smile, muttering thank you.\n\nAfter working for more than two years as a bartender, I’d learned quite a few, and not only on mixing drinks but also the different types of people; from rich kids, playboy, bad boy, flirt ladies, cheating husband, horny guys, brokenhearted, dirty business, and sex, but I also developed a good relationship with my friends despite cynical behavior.\n\nI placed down the order for table-four.\n\n“I got this.” Dice, my barback took the tray with drinks to the couple at the dark red C shaped lounge chair with a half-moon-shaped silver table. With only a red light illuminated around the area, it was perfect for lovers and lonely hearts.\n\nI did my job, and time passed by like a blur. Sometimes, I wanted it that way—it made me forget something I had in mind for the time being.\n\n“Wanna stay for a while?” Kyland asked, opening a bottle of beer.\n\nI shook my head.\n\nOur boss didn’t leave yet either. Pyke settled in front of the bar counter, grabbing the beer that Kyland had just opened. “Thanks, Wright!”\n\n“That’s mine, man.” Kyland groaned.\n\nI chuckled inwardly. They were literally brothers-in-law now. Pyke married Camila, Kyland’s cousin.\n\n“Wanna take it back? Go ahead.” Pyke raised the beer to offer back and laughed while Kyland was glaring back at him. “Then go grab another one.”\n\n“Can’t take for your own, dude?” Kyland scowled.\n\n“What’s gotten into you, Wright? Does your wife not good at giving you orgasms?” Pyke teased.\n\nI had to blink back the thought of what had just happened earlier because if my memory served right, Pyke was quite clueless of them almost bringing down the door.\n\n“Leave her alone, Hughes!”\n\nThey talked about sex quite often when they were both single and might have shared women before. I had no idea. They quitted the moment they were in their serious relationship. I guessed people did change because no one had seen it coming that Pyke and Kyland stopped their sexual escapades.\n\nHow about you, Wood? When are you going to have sex? What I mean sex, the hardcore kind, kinky, and dirty. Have you lost your guymen yet?” Pyke smirked at me.\n\nKyland snorted. “Are you trying to liberate him?”\n\n“Just trying to figure him out, Wright.”\n\nThey might have a few thought I didn’t like women or I was into dick, but who gave a shit?\n\nI shrugged it off. “My sexual exploitation is just fine.”\n\n“Really? Do you have a girlfriend? I know you’re not married, but I never saw you going out of the club with a woman either. Waiting for a perfect girl, huh?” Pyke faced me, piquing his interest.\n\nI shook my head. “No girlfriend. No wife. But I can assure you I have a sex life.”\n\nKyland and Pyke burst into laughter, high-fiving each other.\n\n“Then why do you ask for days off every last week of the month?” Of course, Pyke would ask.\n\n“I have to travel to see my family.” I only had a long conversation with them when they invited me during a weekend or if it was not a work-related topic. I thought they respected my privacy and never asked personal questions, but I caught Pyke often intently staring at me as if he was studying what was behind my facade.\n\n“Of course.” He nodded subtly, seemed not to buy my reason.\n\nAfter bidding goodbye, I walked out of the employee exit to where I parked my Onyx black 2001 Chevy Camaro Z28. I checked my phone for a call from someone as soon as I got inside. Zero.\n\nI pressed the music icon on the screen of the GPS. Instantly, Simple Man played over the Bose speakers. I pulled out into the driveway, tapping my fingers on the wheel to the beat of the old rock music.\n\nNot less than an hour, I arrived at my pad. My pad was secured by an advanced security system that I installed myself. It had a camera on the peephole that no one would even notice. I inserted the key and pressed my thumb above the door handle with a small black square for fingerprint scanning. In less than three seconds, the door clicked unlocked. noveldrama\n\nI locked the door after double-checking to make sure things were in the right places. I chose the colors according to my preferences—black, gray, and white. The dark gray curtain was drawn to block the\n\nlight from the outside of the floor to ceiling glass window.\n\nExhaustion took over me. I’d been awake for more than twenty-hours now. I slumped body to my authentic crocodile skin couch and kicked my shoes off and massaged my temples.\n\nMy mind went back to my phone. No call. I hit the number on my speed dial and it was picked up right away considering the timezone there. “Any update?”\n\nBill Lioner, my tech geek presented our proposal to the Diabetic Research Center in New York two months ago about our proposed project, the Advanced Insulin Glucose Monitoring System or AIGMS. Unfortunately, they turned it down.\n\nAs much as I didn’t want to disappoint him, I couldn’t let his hope high. But if he believed in me and this project, I should at least believe in what we did. I knew Bill and his team worked their asses hard to get this deal. I just hoped it paid their effort.\n\n“We’re halfway through it. We could use a brain you know-\n\n“I am busy.” I cut off Bill. His brain was more than enough for the project, and he knew it. “That’s why everyone is paid handsomely.”\n\n“Right.” I could feel his disappointment even from a hundred miles away. “I’ll email you for the update after two months.”\n\n“Make it after two weeks. I’ll arrange a video conference.”\n\n“T-That’s impossible,” he stammered.\n\n“I am not in a patient mode right now, Lioner. Make it possible.” My voice came out sharp. Bill even gasped from the other end of the line, and he was aware that we were almost running out of time\n\n“Absolutely, sir.” I knew how much this project meant for him. If we could make a breakthrough, he would be the first to get the benefit since he’d been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes back in college.\n\n“Good.” Before I could hang up, something came up my mind. “Bill, I’m sorry.”\n\n“It’s alright, sir.\n\n“I actually have an idea. I don’t know if it’s possible.”\n\n“I’m listening. Nothing is impossible, Forrest.”\n\nI couldn’t help but smile when he called my name. “Let’s say you’re right. Is it possible to put the monitor and the treatment together?”\n\n“You’re saying—”\n\n“I know it sounds crazy—”\n\n“Brilliant! Call me after a week.”\n\nMy brow met in confusion. “Okay?” I hung up the call. Instantly, my lids felt heavy.\n\n“Mama! Mama!” I shouted as I ran toward our burning house.\n\nPeople from our small village were already in chaos with buckets of water to cease the fire. I bit the hairy arm who tried to stop me, then ran faster as soon as I freed myself. I slammed the door with my body and ignored them yelling my name because I knew my mama was trapped inside.\n\n“Mama!” I coughed furiously. My eyes stung, tears streaming down my flushed face. I couldn’t see anything other than the thick dark smoke coming from the kitchen.\n\n“Mama!” I blindly walked and used my hands as my guide.\n\nI opened my eyes slowly the moment I reached the kitchen doorjamb. It was difficult to watch the scorching of huge flame devouring Mama’s cabinet filled with her Chinaware collections. It was like watching a starving animal eating its prey with an enormous appetite.\n\n“Mama!” I shouted, running to where my mama was crawling out under our old wooden table, where we shared many meals. Her swollen eyes were pleading, filled with horror, sadness, and pain.\n\n“G-go, m-my s-sweet boy. S-save yourself,” Mama choked her words out, making me shake to cry.\n\nThere was blood everywhere—on her beautiful face, her favorite white blouse, and on her hands as she pushed me away from her.\n\n“Mama! No, Mama!” I gripped her wrists, dragging her out under the table, but she was too heavy, and she was pulling her hands out of my grip.\n\nI cried for help, but there were no words came out, instead, I continued coughing as the black smoke entered and burned my lungs, making me wheeze and breathe harder. I quickly crawled under the table, ignoring the unbearable heat against my skin that I felt I was melting under. I covered my mama with my body, closed my eyes, and took the fate that was written for me.\n\nThe flame reached the table quickly, to my shirt and licked my skin greedily. The pain was excruciating, and I was helpless to fight.\n\n# Chapter 2 Fired\n\nMEGAN\n\nSuckstastic!\n\nIT HAD been eight days since I lost my job. Eight days of wallowing in self-pity at the four corners of my apartment—alone. And every time I closed my eyes, all I saw was the image flickering of my evil boss as he tried to violate me. He was a shameless piece of shit and thought I would just welcome his loser dick because he had one.\n\nSince I kneed him on his balls and punched his wrinkled ugly face, I hadn’t seen or heard from him again. I was immensely grateful and scared at the same time that cops would just knock on my door informing me that someone sued me for assault.\n\nI’d never been violent in my entire life, in fact, I was always a victim. Then I saw red when he tried to do that thing that I was scared of. My instinct kicked in, and I did what I thought was right to save a little morality I had left.\n\nIt was passed six when I got out of my bed. I tried hard to ignore my urge to call Camila and Bianca because I knew they were both busy with their husbands. And at this time, Blaine was busy playing with Ben and Sammy—who wouldn’t? those kids were adorable. Lucky for them, they met men who respected, loved and treasured them like true gems. But luck was not on my side though, and I doubted if I could trust my heart to any man over again.\n\nI checked my phone, of course, no calls, no messages—no one cared. Naught.\n\nMy life sucks!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Night Stalker Club was crowded. The noises always made me feel alive, reminding me that I still had a reason to live despite my life had been turned upside down a couple of times, reeled and grief- stricken—I still managed to pull myself together. Yay to me!\n\nI passed through the crowd and approached the bar. Thankfully, I found an empty barstool and rested my elbows on the dark counter, tapping my blood red-colored nails as if I wasn’t drowning with self-pity earlier.\n\nMy heart was speeding up in a second of anticipation as I scanned around, but I couldn’t find him. Was he off work today?\n\n“Caipirinha, please?”\n\nDice, a bartender with Afro head nodded. The staff knew me through Camila and Pyke. I hummed to the pop song played by the DJ at his booth.\n\nA few moments later, Dice placed down my drink and placed another order from the man beside me who wore a strong perfume. I turned my head slightly to check him out. He was wearing a sophisticated tailored suit with shiny personalized cuff links. He was rich, probably had his own office in Manhattan business district.\n\nHe raised his Jack on the rocks to acknowledge me and sipped it, then slightly turned to face me.\n\nI smiled timidly and sipped my Brazilian drink, and let the grassy herbaceous taste of cachaça washed over my loneliness. Wash, huh? Ridiculous!\n\n“Hi,” he prompted, smiling confidently. You’re rich but not attractive. I don’t feel all tingly.\n\nI must say though, this man was tall and physically fit, but I didn’t come here tonight to flirt and get laid just to get rid of this sorrow churning inside me. I still couldn’t forget what that dipshit did to me. I\n\nguessed I was born jinx after all.\n\n“I’m waiting for someone.” I crossed my legs to avoid touching his knees.\n\n“He should be here by now. Shouldn’t let a beautiful woman wait.” He raised an eyebrow, testing. Oh, god! Stop flirting already.\n\nI wanted to roll my eyes, instead, I smiled. “What made you think I am waiting for a... man?”\n\nHis eyes glinted wickedly. “As gorgeous as you.” He strolled his gaze from my face to my chest, to my exposed thighs. “It would be a waste.”\n\n“You’re maybe right, but I am really waiting for someone.”\n\n“At least let me entertain you while you’re waiting for his grand entrance.” Back off, already! Your cufflinks are too shiny for my taste. He extended his hand. “Asher.” Oh, come on! Aren’t you a little persistent?\n\nI reluctantly raised my hand to shake his.\n\n“Megan.”\n\nStartled, I choked on my heart and my pulse pounded in my ears. My head snapped to the strong and deep voice behind the bar.\n\nForrest had his dark eyes narrowed at me so intense that made me gulp, with dark thick brows squished together. His straight nose was flaring, his jaw was locked tight that made his jawline sharper. noveldrama\n\n“Il est tellement chaud.” I thought it was my voice.\n\nHis gaze made my knees tremble. This man always carried the pain, mystery, and broody character, but he was damn beautiful with his imperfection. His powerful presence caught me hyper-aware that\n\nhad my body tense and my vagina shamelessly reacted. Oops! I shouldn’t have thought of that. Too late, Megan.\n\n“Forrest.” I coughed his name.\n\nHe took a few moments to somewhat assess me before he talked again. “You okay?\n\nI nodded. Suddenly, it came to my senses that I’d been staring at him for a couple of seconds and not saying anything. It was always this way.\n\n“Yeah.” My word came unsure.\n\n“Can I get you another drink?” He looked down at my almost empty glass.\n\nMy hand turned shaky as I pushed the glass toward him. “Yes, please.”\n\nA man on my left side cleared his throat. I completely forgot I was about to shake his hand. “So, you’re Megan.”\n\nI glanced at him. “He’s here.”\n\n“Wait a sec. You’re dating that bartender?” Did I say anything about dating? He gestured his head to the magnificent back of Forrest who was wearing a black shirt, sleeves were rolled up his elbows, showing off his flames tattooed that I found it intriguing and sexy.\n\nI preferred a clean guy, but it just looked damn good on him. Sometimes I wondered if he had a few more tattoos underneath the dark shirt he was wearing. Did his abs or deep V covered with tattoos as well or did he have a piercing on his flagpole? Bad bad girl, Meggie.\n\nI leisurely watched his biceps bulged as he busied himself mixing. “Nope.”\n\n“Your brother then?”\n\nI snapped my head and stared at the man for good seconds. I opened my mouth, but before I could speak, Forrest placed the drink in front of me.\n\n“Back off, dude. You’re not her type.” Forrest’s voice was deep and harsh, but I could feel that was intentional.\n\n“You’re one to talk.”\n\n“What do you think?”\n\nMy mouth slacked open and parched because Forrest didn’t even open his mouth if he didn’t have to. He was a man of a few words. He used to brood than to spend his time talking to someone like this pompous dumbass beside me.\n\nForrest always intrigued us. I just didn’t have the gut to even talk to him if I didn’t have a choice. He intimidated me like a predator, but something deep inside me triggered every time we locked our gazes —it was like rolling of thunder with warmth and desire, but I had to keep it to myself because he was a friend in my circles. But boy, that’s a damn shame because he looks so good.\n\n“You’re a bartender, dude. Don’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong. I am just asking a beautiful lady over here—”\n\n“Just like you asked another beautiful lady yesterday?”“What is your problem?”\n\n“My problem? Didn’t she tell you she was waiting for someone?” Oh, he heard me?\n\nMy eyes ping-ponged between them while I was trying to process that they were arguing because of me, yet, I couldn’t tell them to stop.\n\nClearly, Forrest pissed off Asher. The dude’s face was flaming red and stoned hard. “I can make a complaint against your rudeness behavior and make sure you can’t find another job even sweeping dog shits in the street.”\n\n“And I am so shaking,” Forrest answered confidently.\n\n“Asshole!” Asher barked harshly.\n\n“You’re not the first time to call me that.” He grabbed the empty glass on my left and a few dollar bills.\n\n“Forrest, what are you doing?” I asked him, finally finding my voice to speak.\n\n“I don’t know,” he mumbled under his breath, then pinned his gaze at me.\n\n“You could be in trouble.”\n\n“Who gives a damn? What are you doing here? Alone.”\n\n“I’m a customer.” I shrugged.\n\nForrest shifted his gaze to my back, and I noticed Asher left his stool.\n\n“This is for you, asshole.” He threw the bills toward the counter then walked away.\n\nForrest picked them up from the floor, then Asher’s empty glass.\n\nI waited until he would talk to me again, but he kept himself busy with the other customers and never came back to me as if I didn’t exist anymore, and it pissed me off. He passed by me when he had to take orders. The rest of the evening remained uneventful.\n\nFeeling insignificant, I drained my drink empty. After a few deep breaths, I pulled myself together, took a few bills from my clutch and placed it on the counter.\n\nWhat happened to me? I wasn’t this attention seeker. I could get attention from any man I wanted. I had a fair share, but I knew that they only wanted one thing from me, and that was what I hated myself for. Or perhaps, I wanted something more. Something else. Or more so, someone. I shook the images of my past life as they passed by in a slow blur and walked out of the club, hoping not to return.\n\nI stayed inside my car for a while, resting my head against the headrest. I couldn’t let my failures consumed me. I needed to find a job, moved on, and forgot those damages happened in my past.\n\nI couldn’t depend on my friends every time I had a problem—we weren’t like before anymore. They had priorities than to listen to my sad life stories that no one could fix it other than me.\n\nPeople thought I had a perfect life because what they saw in me was the flirty and funny Megan, and not the damaged woman behind these walls I built years ago.\n\nI started my car when my eyes started to blur. So much for an emotionally unavailable bitch! A knock had my head snapped to my window.\n\n“Megan?”\n\n**If you like Reading Full story free of cost  tell me in comments and follow me for many more.**",

          "Post Text": "At the beginning of the year my SO and I had to return to 5-days in office after we had just adopted a young puppy late last year. We found a reliable doggy daycare that she goes to now and the staff there have all been wonderful.\n\nLast Wednesday my husband called me on my way home from work. I was stopping at the grocery store and he had picked up our pup. He asked if I would want to pick up fast food and sounded sad, so I asked if everything was okay. He sighed and said, “Yeah just something at (dog’s) daycare today made me really sad so I’m not motivated to eat well today.”\n\nWhen I got home he told me what he witnessed when he came in to get our dog that afternoon. Apparently the staff at the front desk was desperately trying to reach a dog’s owner. The dog in question was a senior who had been dropped off that day for month-long boarding. He was in frail health and was already having a medical emergency - throwing up blood. We both agreed it was suspicious that the owners dropped him THAT DAY - so I doubt they were already out of country - and weren’t picking up.\n\nWe both admitted we thought the worst - that the owners dropped him with the daycare on purpose for the end of his life because they didn’t want to be there for it. Then we felt guilty for assuming what we thought was the worst. (Guess what? It gets worse.)\n\nYesterday when I came in to pick up our puppy I saw the owner there and inquired how things were going with that dog. He had been on my mind and I was hoping maybe it was a misunderstanding. Well, it wasn’t.\n\nThey finally reached the owners who told the daycare not to take their dog to the emergency vet because they didn’t want to pay the extra fee. The man claimed he spoke to his vet (a locally known and respected vet) and to just bring the dog in on Monday to its normal vet IF IT WAS STILL ALIVE.\n\nMy jaw hit the floor so fucking fast on that one. Luckily the owner is a longtime dog owner, breeder, and trainer. She’s run this facility for decades and is friends with this vet, whom she then immediately called.\n\nThe vet said the dog is 14 years old and has leukemia - and has had it awhile. Not only was the dog taken to an emergency vet and given proper medication, but the vet also shared she had told the owners if they insisted on keeping the timing of this trip that they needed to have plans for “final moments” in place for what to do if the dog passes while they’re gone.\n\nSo their solution? Board the dog and abandon it for what is likely its final month alive.\n\nI can only describe the overwhelming desire to beat the pulp out of these people I don’t know as seething.\n\nIt happens that the dog is in a boarding room that I can look into from the lobby so the ladies at the front desk can see him at all times. The owner assured me the staff goes in to see him multiple times a day and he has pain killers to help now and medication. But when I looked in the window the dog looked so fucking hopeless.\n\nHe’s 14. His snout is fully white, he’s some kind of lab box with cloudy eyes. He was laying on his side just staring at the wall listlessly and his eyes looked so fucking sad. Like he lost all hope.\n\nI haven’t stopped thinking about him. I talked to my husband and we agree that he’s in the best hands probably right now with a staff who can attend to him around the clock. The daycare owner has assumed responsibility for his medical decisions since she and the vet are working together but it’s incredibly likely this is the end of this dog’s life.\n\nI want so bad to take this dog home but there’s many, many reasons I can’t. We can’t be home with him all day. We have multiple dogs, not just the young one, and I don’t think we can provide care better than the daycare. But fuck, who does that?! Fourteen years with a dog and you drop him like hot potatoes and skip to Europe when he’s dying?\n\nOh and the owner said they would rather the dog die at the facility FYI. They don’t want to pay the fee for euthanasia. BUT YET EUROPE FOR A MONTH IS FINE.\n\nI tell you, hell isn’t enough for some people.\n\nI saw the dog again this morning and he was curled in the tiniest ball still looking so despaired. All I wanted to do was crawl in that room with him and hold him tight and tell him he wasn’t alone. I know the daycare staff check on him a lot throughout the day and even from how they treated our pup when she was very young, they’re very caring people.  But I don’t know how you can see an animal that despaired and not feel your own heart bleed some.\n\nI ordered a plush memory foam dog bed, a relaxing water fountain, and a little battery-operated anxiety stuffy that mimics slow breathing for him. I don’t know what else you get a dog to make it comfortable near the end, honestly.\n\nThe daycare owner said they don’t need anything but I just want to help him be comfortable if I can.\n\nI’m sitting in my office now, two hours into my work day and I still can’t stop thinking about him. I think I’m going to ask the daycare owner how much it would be if they do have to put the dog down more humanely to see if I can help offset the facility’s expenses some.\n\nMy husband is worried if the dog does die the owners will try to come back and blame the daycare somehow, but the owner mentioned all her communication with them has been through text. Including the owner saying they should just “let the dog die” there.\n\nOh and if you’re the owners reading this from Europe…I truly hope life gives you the shit end of the stick one day. And NEVER get a dog again, please.",

Han sov stort set aldrig som spæd og blev hurtigt overstimuleret.\n\nHans første tid i vuggestuen var ekstremt overvældende for ham, og han mistrivedes direkte i starten.\n\nDet blev heldigvis bedre.\n\nVi flyttede fra København til provinsen, hvor han begyndte i en ny vuggestue. Det har været en god oplevelse, og det meste af tiden er det gået rigtig fint.\n\nNu er han startet i børnehave – i samme institution – og her møder han nogle nye udfordringer.\n\nHan vil virkelig gerne være sammen med de andre børn, men han har svært ved at rumme, at der er 18-20 børn på stuen. Nogle gange slår han ud efter et andet barn uden nogen tydelig grund. Det hjælper ham meget at få en middagslur – det giver ham en mental pause. Pædagogerne har dog nævnt, at han jo skal lære at begå sig socialt, inden han skal i skole. Hvilket jeg tænker, at han nok skal, da der tid endnu\n\nAndre, der kender til denne problematik?",

Bad therapy, not taking movement seriously and injuries after made it worse. In the last year I have made the best and most significant progress. Now I was never a flexible person. Still struggle with even touching my knees on a forward fold sitting down. I grew up heavy, never did sports and pretty much sat around everyday after school. \n\nI started working out about 2 years before my accident. total of 7 years working out but obviously with chronic back pain it was back and forth to PT and rest. I ended up discovering pilates, I was never a believer in it. Thought lifting weights was my only way to get fit. Pilates honestly saved me. I was bed ridden and months away from my last resort being back surgery. Just got back into weight lifting though and feeling pretty good. I know myself way better.\n\nNow I still struggle and have flare ups but this is the best I've ever felt. I have basically no flexibility. I feel like my spine just wants to be upright. My downward dogs are tight(heels never touch ground) and so are my cobra poses, can't even do a real normal squat with heels on the ground.. I was curious about belly dancing. Since pilates helped me learn more about my body and how to feel it/move, I was wondering if you guys would suggest learning belly dancing for someone like me? It just seems like you all become so in touch with yourself and understand your body?? I'd love to be able to move the freely like you guys do. \n\nThanks if you read all of this and replied:)))))",

She gives the camera a dirty look and says \"Shoo!\" Camera shakily moves and focuses on Shady wearing her usual top hat and spiral pelt, her kindred fang earings and lupine claw/ tooth necklace and off the shoulder blouse talking with Rose cuddled up next to her wearing a red leather vest and leggings, spiral tooth jewelry and feather earings swaying as she teases the Baron.*\n\n*Talon argues with Oglivie off to the side where the bets are placed dressed in a cut up Iron Maiden shirt and jeans, Tyler stands not too far off, piercings reflecting in the dim lights. George stands there screaming her head off in her typical wool cap and army jacket. Mia dressed in her fur coat and leathers stares at George and shakes her head, her piercings reflecting with each shake. Next to her Lucius chuckles, his bald head extra shiny and tattoos peaking through the black tank top he wears.*\n\n*camera shakily pans to RK wearing a tight black T shirt and jeans, hair in her usual braids talking to Jason wearing a Bongo t-shirt and flight pants laughing easily*\n\n*Oglivie ignores Talon and stands \"Bets!! Bets!! Our returning Cammie Brawn who's one for one taking on Harper fighting for the Anarchs! Place'em now people!\" Talon throws his hands in the air annoyed and angrily stalks away*\n*Richter walks up to VIP area in his usual white silk shirt and leather pants ( and movie star chin) followed by Airbox's huge form in his typical letterman jacket and jeans. And speaks with the Baron asking where she finds these Amazons eyeing Rose. Shady smirks and shrugs \"Lucky I guess.\" The camera person giggles shaking the camera pans to Shady who holds up a claw to Oglivie who nods and writes something down. \"Gonna hurt Brawns feelings\" Richter says. Shady shrugs \"Gotta bet on my cousin and besides maybe Brawn will finally convert to our side\" laughter.*\n\n*Oglivie closes the bets as The Rocky theme plays and Brawn a huge Nosferatu enters wearing his signature cap, white tank top, jeans and fingerless gloves left side of his face horribly disfigured. He raises his hands to the crowd who roars*\n\n*Then The Smashing Pumpkins's \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\" plays and Harper comes down wearing her hair in a ponytail  dressed in a sports top, tight shorts, and sneakers. The scales on her chest are visible, and she wears her dog tags with a Star of David on the same chain.*\n\n*Harper, a head taller than Brawn, approaches him in the ring. She extends her arms, fists closed and knuckles towards Brawn. He pauses for a second, caught off guard by the boxing handshake as if he wasn’t expecting it. He eventually taps his knuckles to her before he steps back into a stance, his fists close to him. Harper tries a few quick stance changes, starting low like a Gangrel before standing up in a stance mirroring Brawn’s. The match begins.*\n\n*Harper moves first, left hook coming into his side, hitting his ribs. The hammering blow causes a cracking sound to be heard as ribs break. No Potence is used, yet, but Harper is a heavyweight for a reason.\nBrawn jabs a counterattack at Harper’s abdomen and she is already moving. She dodges but she’s yanked off balance, as if moving faster than she was expecting. She recovers quickly but is immediately met by a follow-up jab straight for her face. She cannot move out of the way and Brawn’s fist connects.*\n\n*The blow is loud, silencing the crowd, augmented by Potence, but Harper doesn’t move. Doesn’t even flinch. She smiles as blood runs down from a small cut on her cheek. There’s a flash of red across the sclera surrounding her green cat eyes as she starts pumping the Blood. She immediately follows with a sharp jab into his inner right knee. He hops back, not quite fast enough as her fist glances off his kneecap.*\n\n*Brawn’s balance is off-kilter now. Harper’s grin gets bigger as she knows this fight’s hers. Deciding to end it now, she bends her knees and gets low, uncurling her fingers. The nails on her hands elongate to long, scythe-like black talons, half-a-foot in length each.*\n\n*She lunges forward and low, slashing the back of his left leg with her right hand. His leg gives out, and he falls to one knee. Now, the coup de grâce: her left hand shoots forward in a wicked jab, claws impaling his chest. She lifts him one handed, snarling, a barely contained frenzy, above her head at full height before slamming him into the ground, back first, the tips of her claws going through and into the floor beneath him. The back of his head smacks wetly into the ground, and he does not stir.*\n\n*Her claws retreat as she stands, blood pumping. The whites of her eyes are bloodshot, the fight making her use more than she was expecting. The rust shaken out of her, she exalts in her victory… for now.*",

My mom (my dad has been in and out of the picture, but is not permanently out) knows that my ideal teenage-hood would’ve been in the same house that I grew up in, with at least one childhood friend, the same neighbourhood, the same dog, two parents, cheerleading etc etc. At least, I think she’s observant enough to recognise that. Please don’t misconstrue this as me not being grateful. My mom did the absolute best she could with the resources that she had and i’m incredibly grateful and proud of everything she has done for me AND I wish it could’ve been different. Anyway, she’s been asking me what’s up all day and I was wondering if you would want to hear the truth, straight up? I wasn’t going to tell her as it’s not affecting my mental health and I feel as though it may cause upset- like i said, she did the best she could, but she does like to know things and I do think about it often. \n\nEDIT: I won’t go into specific details about my life because I don’t think it’s necessary, but I do think it’s helpful to include that i’m homeschooled.

          "Post Text": "I have 2 male husky mixes, one is 11 years old and the other is 6. I also have an 11 year old male cat.\n\nWe moved out of the city about a year and a half ago at this point and we're now nestled on half an acre in a much more rural area. The dogs LOVE having so much room to run around and the cat has endless window sills to lounge around in and sunbathe. They've all been loving it here...until the fleas invaded earlier this year.\n\n  \nFor context, as my older guy has aged, he's developed issues with regular hotspots. He's always had really sensitive skin. Generally, they haven't been hard to treat or get him to stop licking at and they've historically gone away pretty quickly. The younger dog has never had any skin issues and has the healthiest skin/coat I've ever seen. My cat has always had healthy skin/fur as well. He is absolutely terrified of anyone that isn't me or my husband, and I'm his favorite of the 2 household humans. \n\nThe second it started getting warm earlier this year, it has been a complete hostile takeover of fleas that we cannot seem to shake. It's been months and I feel like an absolutely awful pet owner for not being able to mitigate this problem effectively. We've done regular cycles of literally everything that has been recommended - we've tried baths, exterminators, diatomaceous earth, flea combing, flea preventative treatments, the collars, we've thrown away dog beds and rugs, done furniture treatments,...you name it, we've tried it. We've dropped upwards towards thousands of dollars in attempting to stop this over the past few months with no luck. At this point, living with &amp; treating the fleas is starting to feel like a full time job.\n\nMy poor boys are in misery. The younger of the two dogs (who has a fuller, fluffier coat) is not really having as much of an issue with it. However, my older animals are really struggling. My older dog with the sensitive skin is chewing on his tail and the spot on his \"ankle\" just above his front foot pads to the point of there being raw bald spots that I have been working diligently with to ensure they don't get infected. My cat is now overgrooming and constantly scratching. The cat is so miserable that he won't let me anywhere near him to clip his nails and he isn't using scratchers enough right now for his nails to be a safe self-grooming length, so he is constantly scratching himself to the point of bleeding (I'm trying to ensure his don't get infected as well).\n\nThis past week, it also seems like both dogs have either developed an ear infection or an ear mite issue. One of their ears each is producing so much stinky, dark brown wax and they're itching on that ear a lot. When I use cleaning pads on them, they both lean their whole body weight into my hand and groan with relief. I'm being mindful not too over-clean their ears and I have this ear drop treatment but it doesn't seem to be working effectively.\n\nI genuinely don't know what to do here and I am being kept up all night long tormented by their discomfort, endlessly looking up any remedies and treatments I can possibly find. They're in so much discomfort that the animals are starting to get snippy with each other, which isn't ideal. Any advice at all is greatly appreciated, I feel awful for my sweet pets. They mean the world to me and seeing them like this is killing me.",

          "Post Text": "For a long while I have been feeling bored by Zen. The problem was that Zen didn't feel personal anymore, or urgent in any way. It didn't feel alive.\n\nMy conception of Zen was simple: Zen is about original completeness, about trust in your own mind, and about not being tied down to any concepts. A very comforting view, but in a way it's too pacifying. If it's just this, Zen is dead and boring.\n\nBut I've come to a realization that made Zen come alive again: True Zen is personal and dangerous. It's found in our confrontation with existential danger in every moment. Existential danger isn’t about physical threat, but it’s the exposure of being fully alive without hiding and without self-deception.\n\nHow did the Buddha become enlightened? He thought about sickness, aging, and death. A confrontation with existential danger. And what did he find? He didn't \"cure\" these afflictions in a conventional, biological sense: he still died a biological death after all. He found that we must unite with this existential danger to be truly alive.\n\n&gt;Zhaozhou asked Touzi, \"How is it when a man who has died the great death returns to life?\" Touzi said, \"He must not go by night: he must get there in daylight.\"\n\nPreviously this case puzzled me. Now it's obvious: Traveling at night is hiding. You sneak in the dark so nobody can see you. The man who died the great death and returns to life, a Buddha, must arrive in daylight. He can't hide from life. By not hiding, he exposes himself to the dangers of the world.\n\n&gt;One day at Nanquan's the eastern and western halls were arguing over avcat. When Nanquan saw this, he took and held it up and said, \"If you can speak I won't cut it.\" The group had no reply; Nanquan then cut the cat in two.\n\nIn this case, Nanquan confronst his monks with death. The monks probably thought he can't be serious, he's gonna let the cat go after all. It's against the precepts, he wouldn't do that. His monks were not ready, they could not act from a place of existential danger. And Nanquan is a dangerous guy.\n\n&gt;Linji said to the assembly, \"There is a true man with no rank always going out and in through the portals of your face. Beginners who have not yet witnessed it, look! Look!\" Then a monk came forward and said, \"What is the true man of no rank?\" Linji got down from the seat, grabbed and held him: the monk hesitated. Linji pushed him away and said, \"The true man of no rank--what a piece of dry crap he is!\"\n\nLinji is a dangerous guy too. He grabs the monk, tries to pull him directly into the moment of existential danger. Zen masters are dangerous because they confront people directly. They don't allow people to deceive themselves and avoid the truth. The truth that is always staring us in the face at every moment. The monk isn't ready though, what a dry piece of shit.\n\n&gt;Venerable Zhaozhou: because a monk asked, \"Is the puppy also Buddha Nature or not?\" Zhou said, \"Not.\"\n\nThe most famous case ever. Zhaozhou denies that all beings are originally complete. That puts us into existential danger. It removes the comforting concept that we must be originally complete (and thus safe). We can't rely on that to give us comfort in the face of reality.\n\nWhy is it that dialogue is the main practice of Zen? It's simple: Zen masters invite the danger. The danger of being exposed to public scrutiny. They enjoy being questioned and having the metaphorical knife at their throat. Fakers can't do it: they need to hide. They must travel at night and avoid the daylight.\n\nTrue Zen must be personal and dangerous. We must travel in the light and not hide from life. And we cannot rely on conceptual understanding as a crutch or for comfort. \n\nIt's alive, it's alive!",

While I took a call, I forgot to lock the door to the outside which has a paddle handle, (not a \"button\" like it says in the paperwork) and she jumped up, hit it, and let herself out. I realized what happened 2-2 1/2 hours later and let her in immediately. Panting, drank a load of water, laid down, just wouldn't stop panting with her ears back. So I took her to the hospital.\n\nAt discharge around 10PM (9:46AM now) they said she was back within normal body temperature and was mildly dehydrated.  The doctor was comfortable with letting her be taken home.\n\nThis morning she still seems weak, wanderng around the kitchen with what sounds like mildly labored breathing, she ate all her food and is still drinking, but didnt go to the bathroom outside with the other dogs. Earlier I heard her yelping a little trying to get up, and I feel like her back legs are weak. \n\nThe doctor told me they put her on painkillers, a \"mild sedative\", took blood, and gave her a catheter. I just don't know if she's still recovering from treatment or if something is still wrong. I'm angry at myself for not letting her stay for observation. What do I do?",

But this leads to his bitching about my talking to “Kelvin” like he somehow owns me.  Scammers hate competition and as subsequent conversations reveal, George was right to be wary.\n\nSince Charlotte refuses to ghost Kelvin, George wants to “reassurance” that we all know he’ll never get.  My offer stands:  if he is that worried about Kelvin, get his ass on a flight to come see me. \n\nNext day he’s heavy into the ChatGPT talking about hot dogs.  Yawn.  I think I prefer Kelvin.  I try to type in ChatGPT style in return but it goes right over his head.  As we talk about ketchup and mustard, I try to fuck with his ChatGPT logic by saying mustard seeds were used by the native tribe known as “The Heinz” to decorate their graves.  ChatGPT of course detects there is no evidence of this, and Charlotte doubles down further by linking the lost Roanoke colony to it.  Seeing that ChatGPT wants to contradict my stories, he drops it.\n\nThen he spits out this gem:  what do I think about a relationship where the woman earns more than the man?  An obvious setup for a future ask, but Charlotte tells him her money is her money.\n\nAnd the Charlotte secrets - yes, I am right handed!  Wow, thanks for that question, George.  Another secret?  OK - Mark Harmon is my real father.  Google that, my dear Yahoo Boy friend.  Then he starts into how financially stable he is which Charlotte replies that there is nothing he can’t do with all this excess income.  After all, “Dolce and Cabana” is his favorite brand.  Right?\n\nAll this talk about his riches will not do and he informs Charlotte that he lost his wallet.  Imagine a man who self-proclaims his wealth being this helpless because he lost his wallet.  He lays the groundwork for an ask that will never really come until it’s too late.  \n\nBut here’s what led to the eventual fall of his scam:  he’s claiming to be on an oil rig in extremely remote Kotzebue Alaska.  This is nowhere near the existing oil pipeline.  It is frozen in for more of the year and has no link to the outside world other than small planes.  That is the last place in Alaska you should say you are working on a rig, but George holds to it as it were a life jacket.  Charlotte demonstrates to him evidence that  there are no oil rigs in Kotzebue and naturally he goes into the boilerplate Yahoo Boy defense of “don’t believe everything you see on the internet!”.  Whatever. I’ve never been to Kotzebue but I have briefly lived in Alaska and know it is one of the most inaccessible communities there.\n\nGeorge then offers to prove to me he’s in Kotzebue by means of a video call.  Those who know Yahoo Boy tricks will know that he will cover the video and say it’s not working.  Charlotte is a firm no but will think about it if he sends a video of Kotzebue.\n\nGeorge then descends back into ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She's really energetic, really fun, and has just been such a good thing overall to have in my house. My husband (41M) initially wasn't crazy about getting a dog but he quickly turned around and was happy to have her around. He wants the dog to be my responsibility since I'm the one who wanted to get her and I've been totally fine with this. It's not too much work. A walk once or twice a day, food and water, and a little bit of training. Just a little bit of time each day to set aside which I'm more than happy to do. Actually still in the process of potty training, but we're getting there! I really enjoy the process of training her and seeing her grow as a puppy.\r\n\r\nNow the problem started because the puppy hasn't exactly had a name for the couple of weeks we've had her, just nicknames and things like that as I can be very indecisive until I find something I love. I've finally landed on a name, Barbara. My husband doesn't like the name for the puppy, and come on! Barb is such a cute nickname, little barbie! He's been quite adamant that I have to pick a different name, and I don't think that's fair of him as it's my dog and my responsibility, so it's my choice on the name as well.\r\n\r\nHe started by saying he was putting his foot down, and that he would change the name for me if the roles were reversed. Now, a few days later he's telling me that it was the name of his dead grandmother. I've never even met her, I never even knew her name was the same as my dog's name! Frankly, I think it might just be an excuse.\r\n\r\nHe's told his brother, who just thought it was a funny coincidence, but his brother told their parents, and now it feels like that whole side of the family is mad at me. It's gotten even worse because he was on the phone with his mother and she overheard me talking to barb as I played with her.\r\n\r\nThey're acting like I'm evil now, but my friends are all saying I'm in the right. I don't know what to think. AITA?",

If you skip the beers you have enough time to go adopt one 😅\n\nFinish it off with grilled onions, american cheese, and a double cheddar skirt on an onion roll and enjoy!\n\nThe last few shots show the aftermath of smoking, it's really not a big deal and cleaned up fine 😆\n\n\n",

The range of the territory is large and will require driving regardless of where I live. I will attach a map showing the territory. With that being said, I am eyeing N/NW Chicagoland as the optimal orientation. \n\nRight now, it will just be my wife and two dogs moving with me. However, my wife is pregnant and we are welcoming a baby later this year! \n\nOverall details:\n\nBudget- Below $2,700. Ideally between $2,000-$2,500 everything included. I am flexible but do not want to spend the majority of my raise on a COL increase. \n\nSpace- 2-3 Bedroom apartment/house for rent. \n\nDesired Amenities- Dog Park, decent gym, nature trails nearby, family oriented parks nearby. Looking for more of a suburb feel. \n\nType of Area- We are NOT looking to stay in a downtown environment. Preferably a suburb with a little more space. We are moving from Midtown Atlanta and are looking for a break from downtown city living. \n\nDemographic- My wife is Colombian and values living in a more diverse community. Strong Latin population is a plus. \n\nI have done some research and have narrowed my desired area down to the highlighted region on the photos. It’s broad but primary areas of interest are Schaumburg, Hoffman Estates, Palatine, Mt. Prospect, Des Plaines, Skokie, and Evanston. \n\nSearching for apartments in this city has been a very different experience than previous cities. Is it worth enlisting a realtor to help in my search? Are my parameters realistic? Things are moving fast and I’m trying to be methodical in this process, but the size of the city is a bit overwhelming without any kind of prior knowledge of the area. ",

          "Post Text": "I have two cats, brothers from the same litter, both almost two years old and around 11–12 lbs. They’re indoor-only and fed at the same time using a dual automatic feeder—separate bowls, fixed portions, usually about ⅔ cup of dry food total per day split into three meals. About three times a week I swap one meal for wet food, and they get treats (both dry and wet) in moderation. They had a quick vet checkup during neutering a couple weeks ago, but the food issues started long before that.\n\nLately, though, one of my cats, Cooper, has gotten obsessed with food—both cat and human. He’s always creeping around, trying to find anything edible. He’s broken into treat pouches and eaten entire boxes. I’ve had to lock my closets and cabinets, but if I forget even once, he’s into hot dog buns, jerky, taco shells, pizza, butter sticks… he even pulled corn on the cob out of the trash. I have to weigh the trash lid down, but if I turn away for a second, he’s already pouncing on it. Just yesterday, I turned around for a moment and caught him licking oil from the air fryer drip tray. He's also licked oil out of my deep fryer, that I now cover up. If I leave food on the stove or even just the remnants of what was in the pan, he will try to lick it.\n\nWhen I’m cooking or eating, he’ll jump on the counter or try to grab food off my plate or even get right up to my mouth while I'm chewing. At the feeder, he finishes his portion in two minutes flat—almost like it’s a race. I think that might be because my other cat, Andy (who’s a little bigger and more dominant), eats next to him. I also hand-feed them wet food and treats, but when I give them squeezable pouches, both will try to yank the packet away with their teeth. I’ve started ending treat time if they get aggressive, but just today, Cooper latched onto a pouch so hard I thought I’d have to wrestle him for it.\n\nThey haven’t been as playful as they were when they were younger, and they seem to get bored of toys quickly. Cooper hasn’t gained weight or shown excessive hunger (no constant meowing, unless it pretty close to feeding time), but I feel like I can’t make a single mistake leaving food around—or he’ll get into it. I’m worried he’s going to eat something toxic one of these days (if he hasn’t already). Any advice on how to handle this?",

I felt the need to clarify some of the issues I raised there.\n\nAfter six years of considering myself a transgender man, I finally opened my eyes and discovered that it was all just stupidity and an attempt to fit into some group. I was told that a person with my interests would not be able to function as a woman, and I slowly started to believe it myself. Now, after so many years, I decided to end this stupid farce and rediscover myself as a woman.\n\nI completely abandoned the Tumblr, deciding that there are too many weirdos, annoying children, and hormonal teenagers on it who need to argue with someone in order to exist. I didn't want to spend any more time in a platform full of people who have some weird views, like considering themselves dogs, which sounds a bit like a mental illness. Lately I've been spending time changing my wardrobe as well as learning the basics of make-up. For now I can only do the most basic, but I sincerely hope that soon it will all change.\n\nI've fallen in love with wearing more feminine clothes like dresses, bracelets, or necklaces. My outfit depends on the day, occasion, or mood. Sometimes I can dress in streetwear, and sometimes I can look like a biker or a tomboy. I believe that clothes don't define a woman. I love wearing dresses, but I wouldn't mind something completely different.\n\nI just want to let people know that you can be a woman with more masculine interests, and you don't have to become a non-binary or trans person. I'm a 22-year-old heterosexual woman, and I don't have to have stereotypical feminine behavior to exist.\n\nEdit. I added a similar post on Actual Detrans, but it was received quite negatively by other users. I decided not to edit it and to paste it in an identical version here as well. Maybe I just have too \"controversial\" views.\n\nP.S. I think I wrote a bit too much about my certain feelings towards a certain group of people, and it probably offended a few people (maybe even more than a few) from the previous subreddit. I shouldn't have done that, but on the other hand, I felt like I wanted to express my opinion on the subject. I've only recently been educating myself about \"internet cultures,\" and I've discovered that I don't mind furries at all, but this other group (who I don't want to name) is a bit weird, especially on TikTok.",

          "Post Text": "This post uses the wolf a specific example, but there's plenty of more animals that fall into this trope. I'm interested in hearing other examples\n\nMy beef here can probably be chalked up to neurodivergent fixation, but ever since I was a child I hated the fact many fairy tales feature a Big Bad Wolf-type character as their primary antagonist. In real life wolves share many of the same qualities we love in our pet dogs like loyalty, playfulness, and family bonds. However during medieval times (within european folklore at least) they went from ambiguous symbolism to more of an outright reprsentation of evil. \"Sheep and wolf\" motifs, beastly werewolves only defeated by silver, and the numerous Brothers Grimm fables featuring them. You don't really see the same demonization of other predators such as leopards or bears\n\nI don't automatically feel this way about every wolf antagonist, Death from Puss in Boots 2 is a good subversion. He's clearly inspired by old fairy tales but way more layered than a scary predator that's evil for evil's sake, however this feels like an exception. Even the more innocent looking examples in this gallery lean on wolves themselves being inherently bad or evil. I know looking at fiction through the lens of realism, especially zoology, isn't particularly fruitful. But the wolf population didn't just dissappear from Europe and America out of nowhere\n\nFrom colonial-era baggage leading to the decimation of the wolf numbers across multiple continents, to recent cases of cruelty such as a Montana man who ran over a wolf while driving a snow mobile then paraded the injured animal through a bar before executing it, on top of out-of-touch politicans trying to remove protections against killing them, I never liked the Big Bad Wolf trope as it feels overplayed and out of touch\n\nWhat are other animals you guys feel get unfairly shafted by popular media? What are some exceptions that depict said animals in a good light?",

          "Post Text": "I (23f) have been dating my boyfriend (36m) for almost two months, we’ll call him ‘Scott’. The date we started talking was May 2nd. I’m sure the age gap plays a part in this, but I’ve always been attracted to older guys, so the age gap doesn’t bother either of us. Another thing to mention is that he’s paralyzed from the waist down, which is relevant for part of the story.\n\nScott has just gotten out of a divorce after a 10 year marriage, he was finalizing it when we got together. I feel like he’s always comparing me and the way I do things to his ex-wife, saying things like “her and I always did it this way, it’s what I’m used to” and “she’d help me with this, so you should learn how to do it too.”\n\nScott was super sweet to me when we first started talking, and was wanting to “spoil” me, saying “it makes me feel good knowing you feel good about yourself”. He paid for my nails, bought me sexy panties, and made me get a wax (brazilian), which is all very new to me considering I don’t make a lot of money with my job and am unable to get most of those luxuries. He talked about sex a lot, and me personally, it’s hard for me to just enter a sexual relationship with someone. I’m overweight, have been all my life, so I struggle with my body image and feeling sexy. He says he wants to buy me clothes so I can “strut around so he can admire the view” which I have worked on getting out of my comfort zone for that.\n\nI was honest with him about being nervous to fool around due to my own insecurities. At first he was totally understanding and kept telling me that I was worth the wait. And during that time, I had a few things going on that made me a bit down, so I was never feeling ‘in the mood’. But on May 22nd, 20 days after we started talking and me coming over to his house every other night, he asked me if I knew “when we’ll fool around?” His exact words were “I didn’t think not fooling around would be such a big deal but now it’s like a weird subject and I don’t really like it.” I told him that I would prefer the lights to be off and he didn’t want that. He CONSTANTLY talks about sex, all the time, and I want my relationship to be more than that. He then told me “my play time gas tank just needs to be filled up soon”. So then I told him we’d fool around that weekend since now I felt like I had to put a date on it or he’d forget me.\n\nSince then, we’ve fooled around a few times, and I have grown a bit more comfortable. However, he lives with his mom currently because of the wheelchair, so we couldn’t be too loud. This is when things start to change. \n\nAt first, his mom was super nice to me. But lately she’s been telling him that she doesn’t want him\nto bring anyone to the house. It makes him mad, rightfully so, since he pays half the bills there and it’s his right to have anyone there, especially me. He’s on my side with things, and still invites me over after fighting with his mom, but at that point I just stay in his room so I don’t cause any issues. \n\nIt’s gotten to the point where he wants to move out now. We have talked about living together, marriage, things like that. I’ve always wanted to be married and have a life with someone, but after what happened last night, I’m realizing that I’m fantasizing about the IDEA of it, and maybe not ready for the real thing.\n\nWe started looking at houses, I currently live in an apartment. I told him that a backyard is super important to me since I have two dogs that would absolutely love it. And obviously we would need a house that doesn’t have stairs inside/leading to the front door. I have stairs leading to my apartment, so he hasn’t come over to my place yet. I sent him a picture of the stairs, and he told me that I would be able to help him down them. \n\nThat’s when he told me he could just move into my apartment for the time being until we find a place tougher. His words were “until you’re comfortable living with me.” He knows I’ve never lived with a guy, and I’ve been living alone in my apartment for only four months or so. I moved here away from family specifically to be on my own for a bit. He told me I’d HAVE to put all of my money with his and let him manage it. \n\nHearing him say all of this was giving me a bad anxiety I haven’t felt in a long time. It was scaring me. This is where I think I might be overreacting. Those feelings were just telling me all the things about him that I didn’t like. Certain ways he talks to me, certain things he says, and the fact that I don’t know if I could be with someone who I can’t physically make love with and it’s all just him using his fingers on me. Which doesn’t feel that great, by the way.\n\nHe wants to move into my apartment with me and we’ve been together less than two months. Our conversation happened last night, and even as I’m typing this it makes me shake. I told him he was scaring me, and he apologized, but I haven’t texted him yet this morning. Part of me wants to just block him on everything and never talk to him again, but I know that’s wrong. Another part of me just wants to let him move in since he’s in such a shitty situation with his mom. I don’t really know what to do right now, but I’m so scared and anxious about this whole situation, I feel like I might be overreacting. We’ve only spent the night together one night. I know that being with him, in a wheelchair, it means I’m going to have to care for him in some way, and there’s a ton of factors I don’t know about yet, and I don’t know if I’m ready for it yet. I don’t know what to do. AIO???\n\nEdit: sorry for such a long post. I’m still feeling anxious about it that I just couldn’t stop typing. Sorry if I explained too much about our relationship.",

Their 3.50 ERA and 96 home runs (good enough for 10th in MLB) suggested they’d rather hit with the precision of a laser than pitch with the scatter of a drunken piñata.\n\nEnter the Oakland Athletics (32-48), fresh off a double-whammy of 4-2 and 3-0 losses to the Cleveland Guardians. Oakland’s 5.43 ERA, though, made their pitching staff look like a group of kindergarteners manning a T-ball league. Yet their 98 homers (8th in MLB) proved they could swing for the fences like they were on a taxpayer-funded expense account.\n\n**Key Players? More Like Key Comedians:**\n\n* **Tarik Skubal** (Tigers): The ace who probably practices yoga between starts to avoid looking too human.\n* **Luis Severino** (A’s): A pitcher whose ERA could double as a horror movie title.\n* **Riley Greene &amp; Co.**: The Tigers’ offense, which seems to have discovered the concept of “consistency” in 2025.\n* **Jacob Wilson &amp; Co.**: The A’s sluggers, determined to make Comerica Park their personal home-run derby practice range.\n\n**Recent History? More Like Recent Embarrassment:**  \nDetroit had just been drilled 8-3 by the Tampa Bay Rays the day prior—a game where the Tigers scored 3 runs, a number that made their fans question if they’d accidentally play baseball in slow motion. Meanwhile, Oakland’s 23 wins as underdogs this season were about as shocking as finding a functioning fire alarm in a abandoned warehouse.\n\n**The Verdict:**  \nThis game was less of a contest and more of a “Which Star Will Explode First?” episode. The Tigers, favored to win like a golden retriever at a dog show, faced a Athletics squad that’d need to summon every ounce of magic (and maybe a time machine) to pull off an upset. In the end, it was a night where the only thing clearer than the stats was the fact that nobody—not even the Guardians—wanted to watch this matchup on a Tuesday.\n\n*Final Score Predictions?* Let’s just say if the A’s scored 10 runs, MLB would probably investigate for performance-enhancing donuts.\n\nVisit [https://www.gptsportswriter.com/recap-detail/recap-detroit-tigers-vs-tampa-bay-rays-2025-06-22/](https://www.gptsportswriter.com/recap-detail/recap-detroit-tigers-vs-tampa-bay-rays-2025-06-22/) for more recaps.",

I have a decent size fenced backyard so he still goes out and plays and does what he has to do. My knee is not fully recovered either so when my dog pulls my knee is almost about to give out and if it does I will more than likely get dragged all over the ground. \n\nAnd before y’all come to the comments to shit on the ears, boohoo get over it. \n",

I been trying to get her kicking me on video but she never does when I have the camera out. \nI’ll break down the events leading up to the kick just now. \n\nSo my bf left for work this morning her and I walked him out. She went potty and ran an around for a little bit but she knew it was breakfast time so she was eager to come in to eat. We did our breakfast ritual she ate and when I went to sit down she ran and tried to take my spot… there’s like 4 feet of more couch but she wanted my spot. I moved her over to the other side of me because I wanted the arm. I was petting her and giving her loves and when I stopped to pick up my phone to take a vid (I cut down the video because the kick most likely would have been missed) she kicks me hard. But she has kicked me harder…. Why is she doing this? Does she think the couch is hers? Or that loves is over when she says? But she’ll kick me even when giving loves. \n\nAlso she has cherry eyes the breeder gave her away to me I plan to get them resolved at the vet,\n",

She loves this dog — and I get it, the dog is smart, affectionate with people, and has a strong personality. But the problem is… I already have a dog — a smaller male (Pomeranian mix) named Bleu — and this new dog has now attacked him three times.\n\nEach time, it’s been under different triggers: •\tOnce when food was nearby •\tTwice when Bleu had the zoomies and was just running around\n\nBefore she attacks, the collie locks in on him — slow stalking, intense stare, then lunges. It’s not playful or warning behavior — it’s full-on aggression. She does the same stare and creep behavior when she sees rabbits outside too.\n\nBleu is now walking around our house nervous and on edge. Bleu is not a saint either.. he definitely protects his humans with growls when other dogs get close. He will nip at other dogs but not attack with aggression.\n\nWe’ve been trying to separate them, but it’s hard in a shared home. And the reality is, this isn’t just a one-off incident. It’s a pattern. I’m terrified the next time she goes after him, it won’t be a nip — it’ll be a vet visit… or worse.\n\nMy girlfriend is attached to the new dog and wants to make it work, but I’m stuck feeling like I have to choose between: •\tProtecting the dog I’ve had for years who trusts me, or •\tTrying to manage an unpredictable dog in a multi-dog home that may never be safe for him\n\nI’m not posting this lightly — I love my dog and I’m devastated that it’s even come to this. But I think I might have to rehome Bleu for his own safety — to someone I know and trust.\n\nHave any of you dealt with a situation like this before? Is there any chance this can be fixed through training, or am I just delaying the inevitable?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.",

DOM steel offers excellent strength and weldability at a relatively lower cost. Chromoly, on the other hand, provides a superior strength-to-weight ratio, allowing for a lighter cage without compromising safety. Cage thickness varies depending on the manufacturer and intended use,but a minimum wall thickness of 0.095 inches (for DOM) or 0.083 inches (for Chromoly) is generally recommended for adequate protection. The S2000 must have proper support in the form of reinforcement plates.\n\n**Design and Configuration:** Clarification of various design and configuration choices.\n\nRoll cage designs for the S2000 typically range from simple bolt-in half cages to more complex weld-in full cages. Half cages offer basic rollover protection and are easier to install, requiring less modification to the vehicle. Full cages provide comprehensive protection,extending throughout the cabin and often incorporating features like door bars,harness bars,and gussets for added strength. The design should prioritize driver headroom and accessibility while maximizing structural integrity. The design of the roll cage affects style as well.\n\n**Welding Quality and Precision:** Insight into the importance of the welding quality.\n\nThe quality of the welds is paramount in a roll cage. Professionally TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welded cages are preferred due to their superior strength and clean appearance. Consistent, even welds that penetrate the material fully are essential for ensuring the structural integrity of the cage.Poor welding can significantly weaken the cage and compromise its ability to protect occupants in a crash. A high quality roll cage needs to be professionally installed.\n\n**Ease of Installation and Fitment:** Understanding the ease installation.\n\nBolt-in roll cages are designed for relatively easy installation and can typically be installed by experienced DIYers with basic tools. However, some drilling and modification may still be required. Weld-in cages necessitate professional installation by a qualified fabricator.Proper fitment is crucial for both safety and aesthetics. The cage should fit snugly within the S2000S cabin, providing maximum clearance for occupants while minimizing interference with interior components. Check for support bars as well.\n\n**safety standards and Certification:** Certifications indicate the safety and reliability.\n\nReputable roll cage manufacturers often design and test their products to meet safety standards set by organizations like SCCA (Sports Car club of America) or NASA (National Auto Sport Association). While not all cages are formally certified,compliance with these standards indicates a commitment to safety and quality. it's advisable to choose a cage that meets or exceeds the requirements for your intended racing or track day activities.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## Core Benefits\n\nRoll cages will provide you with a grate set of benefits.\n\n**Enhanced Safety and Rollover Protection:** The most obvious and critical benefit is the meaningful increase in safety provided by a roll cage in the event of a rollover accident. The cage acts as a protective structure, preventing the roof from collapsing and potentially causing serious injury to the occupants. This is especially significant for track days and motorsports where the risk of a rollover is higher. The driver's safety needs to be paramount.\n\n**Improved Chassis Stiffness and Handling:** A properly designed and installed roll cage can significantly improve the overall stiffness of the S2000's chassis. This increased rigidity reduces chassis flex during cornering, leading to more predictable handling, improved steering response, and enhanced grip. This benefit is particularly noticeable on track or in autocross events where precise control is essential.**Added Driver Confidence and Peace of Mind:** Knowing that your S2000 is equipped with a robust roll cage can significantly boost your confidence behind the wheel. This peace of mind allows you to push the car to its limits without constantly worrying about the potential consequences of an accident.This confidence can translate into improved performance and a more enjoyable driving experience.\n\n**Aesthetic Enhancement and Customization:** Beyond their functional benefits, roll cages can also enhance the aesthetic appeal of your S2000. Available in a variety of finishes and colors,a roll cage can add a touch of aggressiveness and motorsport flair to the vehicle's interior. Many owners also choose to customize their cages with padding, harness mounting points, and other accessories.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## FAQs Section\n\nAddressing common questions about roll cages.\n\n**Will a roll cage affect my S2000's resale value?**\nThe impact on resale value can vary depending on the type of cage, the quality of installation, and the preferences of potential buyers. A professionally installed, high-quality cage that is aesthetically pleasing and complements the car's overall style is likely to maintain or even increase its value, especially among enthusiasts interested in track days or motorsports. However, a poorly installed or overly aggressive cage may deter some buyers.\n\n**Is it possible to install a roll cage myself, or is professional installation required?**\nBolt-in roll cages can often be installed by experienced DIYers with the appropriate tools and skills. However, it's crucial to follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully and ensure that all connections are properly secured. Weld-in cages always require professional installation by a qualified fabricator. Proper welding is essential for ensuring the structural integrity of the cage, and improper welding can compromise its effectiveness in a crash.\n\n**Will a roll cage interfere with the operation of my convertible top?**\nSome roll cage designs may interfere with the operation of the S2000's convertible top, especially full cages that extend high into the cabin. It's essential to choose a cage that is specifically designed to work with the convertible top or be prepared to make modifications to accommodate the cage. Some owners choose to remove the convertible top altogether for track use.\n\n[[Explore Top Rated roll cage s2000 on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=roll cage s2000)\n\n## Competitor Comparison\n\nA comparison between S2000 roll cage options.\n\n### Product Comparison Overview\n\n#### Hard Dog Roll bar\n- **Material:** DOM Steel\n- **Design:** Bolt-in, Half Cage\n- **features:** SCCA/NASA Approved\n- **Price:** (Price Range)\n\n#### Kirk Racing Products Roll Cage\n- **Material:** DOM or Chromoly Steel\n- **Design:** Weld-in, Full Cage\n- **Features:** Customizable Options, FIA Compliant\n- **Price:** (Price Range)\n\n#### Ballade Sports Roll Cage\n- **Material:** DOM Steel\n- **Design:** bolt-in/Weld-in options, Half/Full Cage\n- **Features:** Various styles, Affordable Pricing\n- **Price:** (Price Range)\n\n### Key Differences Summary\nHard Dog offers a well-respected bolt-in option favored for its ease of installation and track-day readiness.

It's not always the same dream, but I've dreamt about the end of the world multiple times over the past few months\nRanging from parasites who infect the whole planet and make us eat each other to simple stuff like nuclear bombs which made us mutate.\n\nThis last one felt... Too real? My body usually doesn't even care about my dreams, but today I fell asleep twice since I woke up too early.\nI was in a video game the first time, and I was the creator of a mod for said game in which you could throw something like a nuke and it would expand slowly to engulf the whole world, creating in its path monstruous figures, since I was testing the mod I was watching stuff go down in that world, but... I was scared, I couldn't go into the range of the explosion for some reason.\nAfter escaping and setting up a little base, I lost every power, I wasn't able to turn the console on anymore and before I realized, I was already my own character in a world which I had doomed. I was scared, really scared and anxious to which I tried digging a hole to get to the caves and escape.\n\nThat dream ended as suddenly as it begun and I woke up kinda nervous before I felt sleepy again and none of my friends were connected to do anything, so I went to sleep.\nThis time it was the sun, not only the sun but the moon too, they were colored red and mere exposition to them would cause severe damage to your skin over time. I reunited with a friend from years ago.\nI was me in this dream too, during the whole dream, I usually turn into characters from videogames or other people, but this time I was me during the end of the world.\nMe and the friend I mentioned before were walking to my house so I could get to safety, since he lives nearby and had no problem with getting to his house, when I got to my door he disappeared as I struggled to get my keys in the door.\nThe moon was watching me, it could see me and was tearing through my clothes to get to my skin and kill me. I ran over to my aunts home which was 2 houses over and asked if she had any spare keys or space in her home, she said no to both and got back into her house as I figured out I had another pair of keys in my backpack.\nThe dream paused for a few seconds of total darkness. Before I realized, I wasn't even on what I thought could be my country, it was barren and I was near a mountain with my parents so we could get some shadow to keep surviving, which we did for about 4 in-dream days: each day we were getting less and less food, our pet was also with us but she was a different kind of dog for some reason... My moms whole body was unable to move by the 4th day and my dad's hurt too much to do anything plus his vision was gone already.\nMy duty was to survive this last day, I made some pizza, if you could call it that, which they loved as their meal. That fifth day, when I woke up, both of them died on their sleep and I could hear a loud noise, it was so loud my brain hurts a lot... I got up from my bed very weak and instantly fell to the ground, I could see it. The sun was reaching through my room's door and it was looking into my soul to take it away with the rest of this dead planet.\nI woke up almost crying and thanked to everything and everyone that it was just a dream.",

I am not seeking any kind of medical advice for my dog. \n\nSo, the situation: My SD (5yo) was recently diagnosed with minor arthritis in one elbow. The vet said that it is incredibly minor and that she is not concerned about him continuing to work as a service dog for the time being. The plan of action she recommends is a daily dose of anti-inflammatories and, if those aren't enough, a twice-yearly injection (the anti-inflammatories seem to be perfectly effective, so she feels he doesn't need the injection right now). We'll re-evaluate with x-rays either once a year or twice a year (depending on if he shows any signs of it worsening) to check on how it's doing. She's assessed him for pain since he got on the anti-inflammatories and feels confident that he's fully comfortable now that he's taking them, and he isn't experiencing any side effects from them.\n\nShe said that with this type and level of arthritis, she sees no need for changes to daily activities, including service work (so long as our treatment plan is effective, which so far it seems to be). She doesn't feel that his regular activities will make it get any worse than it would naturally; it will progress (unfortunately) with normal aging, but not be impacted by his daily activities right now. As long as any pain is managed properly, which it is now, he is medically cleared to work, I guess you could say. \n\nI'm getting a second opinion from an orthopedic vet early next month, not because I doubt my vet's diagnosis but because I'd just like someone more specialized to give me an additional opinion on my SD continuing to work. \n\nI'm also interested in perspectives from other handlers, not necessarily in the form of advice for my specific situation, but opinions and food for thought about a dog with a ***managed*** medical condition continuing to work with vet approval. My boy's well-being is much more important than his job, so I want to make sure I'm considering all elements of the situation. ",

          "Post Text": "I'm one week post-op. I have disc degeneration disease in my spine, SI joint dysfunction, and a myriad of other health issues. I've come to learn some things that might help so I thought I'd share. \n\n-Pillows are your best friend.\nIf you're in the hospital or freshly out, overnight yourself a freaking wedge pillow and body pillows if you don't have any. Flat, standard size pillows can help as well, but you need elevation and cushion when (if) sleeping. Have a friend, caregiver, partner etc lean and pick up the boxes and open them for you after delivery. Doing it solo? Use every pillow and blanket in your house for support.\n\n-Put a fan on yourself. \nListened to my pillow suggestion? Great, now you need AC and a fan so you don't sweat to death overnight.\n\n-Don't even bother laying flat once you're home.\nNo, seriously. Bed will SUCK! You might find yourself missing the mobile hospital beds. 🤯 You'll try gently turning on your side for some relief and comfort and start screaming because suddenly your tummy shifted and pulled all your weight and incisions to one side. If you *have* to try (because you're human), tuck a flatter pillow under your back and side and roll while holding the pillow to your abdomen. Then breathe a lot, keep shifting, get to your back and try elevating your upper half before hobbling out of bed. Laying on my back sucks because of my disabilities, and the fact that I can't move much means a numb and sore tailbone and hips. Meds, heat, ice.\n\n-Truly, I cannot recommend ice and heat enough.\nNo more of that 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off BS. Heating pad on your back, ice packs from the hospital that you took home with you on your abdomen. Wear a loose t-shirt so you don't burn/freezerburn yourself. Don't sue me if you do.\n\n-Fat tummy people rest their arms/elbows on their abdomen. Oops! You have incisions and trauma on your arm rests now.\nWhen sitting up, prop pillows and blankets on either side of you so your arms can rest on those. Bathing and toileting sucks. I have a toilet chair/shower chair with arms and a back because I need the back support. Consider a cheap one from your local store if you have back issues like me.\n\n-If you're blessed to have friends or family to check in on you, they will, at all the worst times.\nWhen you finally fall asleep, your sister will call. Prioritize yourself during this time so that you can heal properly. Tell them you'll text or call first. Force them to check your incisions for you to make sure nothing's wonky. 😁 Doing it solo? A mirror and a phone ring light. Do. Not. Pull. The. Glue.\n\n-Snacks. By your place of comfort.\nYou know your diet and what you do or do not like. Don't eat a cheeseburger. Do get some fiber, veggies, soup, applesauce, etc. Keep something like protein bars and lots of water by your resting place. Take it slow and easy. NO dairy, god.\n\n-Get a grabber. \nThose sticks with the clamp end thingies help when you inevitably drop everything. Don't even try bending over. Don't do it.\n\n-Don't panic read.\nYou will probably see lots of people saying they were hiking a mountain by day 4 and could lay on their stomachs by day 6. Yay for them. You will probably feel like shit for a good few weeks. This is okay. What is an emergency will be talked over with you by your team at the hospital and in your discharge papers. Advocate for yourself.\nYou will read even more stories of people suffering over 6 month periods with endless complications. This could happen to you. Hopefully, it won't. Be deliberately slow, careful, monitor your body but do not obsess. Watch TV. Knit. Pet your dog. Anything to keep from doomscrolling.\n\n-You might mourn.\nYou might have medical nightmares stemming from your time in the hospital. Remind yourself that you're okay. You're valid. Have grace for yourself. You might cry a lot. Partially from pain, partially from frustration and exhaustion, partially from self pity ... partially because you might mourn your organ, your body, your mobility, your skin pre-incision. This feels silly, but it's okay. Let yourself feel it and then watch a funny video. Or don't, because laughing hurts.\n\n-Keep up on your med schedule.\nOf course, try to slow the opiates or whatever harder medicine you got as you can. But actually keep up your maintenance pain meds, as in, maybe setting a nightly alarm to wake you for your next dose so you can get out of bed in the morning with less discomfort. It sucks, but it keeps the inflammation at bay and gives you a better chance of feeling decent through your days. \n\n-Final thoughts.\nIf you find that being in a recliner or couch is most convenient for you each night? Do that shit. Press a pillow to your tummy when you need to cough. Use your stool softeners so you don't strain. Drink water even though constant trips to the bathroom suck, but be happy because walking unfortunately makes you feel better. I have to use a rollator in my day to day life, so this can help when standing. Slowly stretch your arms up and around to release all that pesky gas. Hold that pillow to your abdomen when tooting. Sitting up super straight helps get it out. Again, avoid dairy. Sure you want bowel movements, but not whatever THAT is. Take your time and keep your head up.",

I'm coming from Drukhari where I could easily dump 10 OC onto an objective with a disposable 5 man unit from much further away than the enemy was expecting which was always fun so that's tempting me.

As such, information structure may be a bit different across translations.\n\nImage 1 Sentence: These sentences happen when trying to talk to the ghost you're stuck with as a spirit medium. This sentence its word order, is the same.\n\n|1|2|3|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Suggesting Discourse marker \\[entering + Volitional (hypothetical + Presenting two hands)|We (Left person + Privatex2)|Going (same as chinese, crossing at an intersection)|\n|Someplace (space(=hill+dot) + Something (a cross))|Specifying linker (line + Specific). specifies what kind of ''someplace'' it is.|You (left person + Other (a sitting/bending person). |\n|Not (some variant of 亥 roots I got from zhuyin/bopomofo)|Seeming like/appearing (basically a fusion of similar/same 同+ Eye)|Crazy (head + Twisted/entangled thread)|\n|Homeless (left person + Homeless (roof + Without (a child without arms))|Asking Interjection (Mouth + Open mouth person)||\n||||\n\nCould have also picked the suggesting interjection, but this makes it sound more polite. However, he's using it sarcastically kinda like saying ''your majesty'' when you clearly don't mean it. I think it fits his character/tone that way.\n\nImage 2 Sentence: (sorry for accidentally leaving no gap in the last char oops). Sentence is also mostly the same but ''The wall is great conversation'' is too grammatically idiomatic. So the verb ''makes for'' is used. This verb is considered a function verb, but its usage is like that of a function word. ''In private'' is an adverb and adverbs come before what they modify. In this case it modifies the main verb, so it comes before the verb. \n\n\n\n|1|2|3|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Unless (if + forked path)|You (left person + Other)|Wanting auxillary (heart + Aux line)|\n|Explaining (Saying + Breaking down)|Discourse marker linker.

However, the spreadsheet is lacking a lot of info. The new chars have no image. Many chars also still need to be fixed in being overly dense  (I've already fixed quite a few, but not their spreadsheet entries). There's also still some issues with duplicates or mistakes. We're aiming for 10 thousand, so I'm getting close. Also I got a buncha cute little added animal components! So that's nice.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\-The font of 6000 chars was a failure. It was simply unreadable due to the squash/stretching method and I can't do it any better. I then lost a bunch of progress but don't know which were and weren't fixed yet from prior issues so I abandoned it. Then I later realized Many chars were also too dense to be feasible to begin with. Nowadays I'm working on a 16x16 pixel art font as a compromise inspired by these little images I was doing. I now just save them as an image, and in the future I may once again turn it into a typable font. All base components now have a character. About 2200 images are there, but they include systemic variants.\n\n\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\n**Grammar Update:**\n\n**-**There are simply more function adverbs, auxillaries, linkers and ''prepositions'' I hadn't gotten to yet. Adverbs like ''Doing to the limit'' or ''doing something all over the place''. Auxillaries like ''predoing''. There's a second ''regarding, about'' character that doesn't necessarily mark the topic of the convo. Like in ''Do you want to hear about my dog?''. ''sorted by'' (listing + Pipes). There's a few more classifiers too, like one you could use for radiowaves or lights, particle stuff we can't see. I think the most interesting addition are ''hybrid classifiers'' to make co-ordinate rather than subordinate compounds. \n\nThese aren't put in front of a character but in between. For example, Human + Hybrid Agent + Horse. This means you're a human horse hybrid..Like a centaur. Normally, if I'd do ''Human + Horse'', it'd more imply I'm a human first, and horselike second. Ofcourse, it still doesn't say what kind of hybrid it is, that'd have to be specified. If then we want a compound with multiple chars, either we use spaces, or we add a line to the hybrid character. 1 at the bottom for an extra char in front, 1 at the top for an extra char after, and at both for an extra char for either. This is systemic, these are seen as character forms, not unique chars. Yes, my language has grammatical character forms. It has conjugation, inside characters. This was less inspired by some other language and more out of realizing my diacritics couldn't be relied on.\n\n\\-There are verb forms now that are considered conjugations, so they do not need two characters in their non diacritic forms. There is  \n\\-Complete, Incomplete, Continuous, Result, conditional, Hypothetical/Subjunctive (I haven't made this one yet..), Going, Coming, Causitive, Passive and Imperative. These then, may or may not have forms for:\n\n\\-Future, Past, Continuous, Continuous Future, Continuous Past, Complete and Incomplete. This means there's like...80 verb form characters. Yup. It's a lot to learn. But they should mostly follow similar patterns. Any remaining compound conjugation, still requires two auxiliaries. \n\nKeep in mind, that these conjugations do NOT always correspond to english usage/meaning. For example, the complete form is what is typically used, and not as often as english just like in Chinese or French. The past form is typically used when it being the past is specifically relevant or emphasized, so it tends to have an implication of it not being that way anymore, how things used to be. Saying \"I was friends with him'' doesn't typically mean ''I'm talking about the past, and in that past period I was friends with him, I'm still on good terms but I don't hang out as much now''. It typically means the other possible interpretation ''I used to be friends with him, but nowadays not at all..''. Complete past then, is not ''something that was completed talking about the past.'' Instead, it has this feeling of not being able to return to what it was before. What's done is done. It's a bit closer to ''-te shimau'' in Japanese. You have to treat ''past'' and ''future'' a bit more like moods rather than time frames.\n\n\\-the 4 ''Internal diacritics'' exist. Essentially, The basic sets of function words that aren't relationship ones, are marked. They make for unique characters, but are not considered separate characters to learn save for some shortened ones. These internal diacritics are mandatory, while other diacritics which are either at the top or side of the character, are not. The shapes of them are a line at the top (with a little hook to make it clear from which row it is), a line at the bottom, and a gapped line at the top or bottom.   \n  \ntop = Linking. Gapped at top = compound relationship. Bottom = Classifier. Gapped at bottom =. Because there's only a limited set of chars they'll be used on, and because they're used in similar contexts, it should be readable enough despite just being added lines.  I could technically also give the relationship chars the auxillary lines, but I chose not to as this makes it easier to see where the verb is. That does mean that if we want to use the subject noun for the abstract concept ''From'' we have to add the abstract entity classifier or relationship classifier  in front, but I just don't think there's many scenarios where you'd want to do this.  Note: Conjugations do not use the auxillary marker, as..They're always used as auxillaries.\n\n\n\n\\-All diacritics were updated, and there's also a smaller set of diacritics to use called the ''medium level of detail''. \n\n\\-Basic Descriptor of quality/stative concepts can be used as adjectives by placing them in front of characters. by default. These include things like: Big, Small, wide, tall,  happy, sad, angry, etc. Using those chars as a verb, typically requires a specifier as to what you mean anyway. Do you mean ''to make sad (sadden) or to act sad?), which will make it clear it's a verb. Other adjectives, will require 2 characters as it's not clear from context whether they're a verb. These include things like ''Investigative'' ''attributive'' ''Cinematic'', etc. This works I think as it's quite in line with the morphology of various languages I know anyway, but doesn't require me to make yet another set of adjective chars for everything. The numbers of chars would compound quite a lot.\n\n\\-Basically all General use/basic/common adverbs and semi-function adverbs have their own adverb characters now. While this adds like 100+ more chars, it's worth it because we use them a lot and it really needs that space to compete with English. These are adverbs like ''directly'' ''Clearly'' that are used more like auxillaries (it's clearly bad..), as well as basic content ones like ''quickly'', or ''carefully''.  Whether they are used in a content way or a more auxillary way typically depends on whether you put it in front of the sentence part vs the verb.\n\n\\-There are modifier characters for anything that does not fit the above. They typically start with Roof and then the type of thing. It's similar to Chinese's 3 ''de'' chars, although those also correspond to some of my ''linker'' characters. There is an:\n\n\\-Adjectival Modifier. Use your adjective, then the modifier char, then what it modifies. Big Modifier Cat = Big cat. Though...Big is a basic descriptor concept, so you don't need to use it here, technically. It uses ''quality''\n\n\\-Adverbial Modifier. It uses ''manner''. This one's for adverbs instead. Note that standalone function adverbs don't need it.\n\n\\-Nominalizing modifier. These turn it into a relative clause. This is a very common structure. It uses ''joining''\n\n\\-Action modifier. This is for compound verbs, as verb phrases aren't explicitly marked. Other sentence parts can just put two chars together quite easily, but not verbs, it's important to be able to get where the verb is. \n\nThe modifiers may have extra versions for marking compounds. The action one just adds horizontal lines. The adverb/adjective add a square. If you want to make longer compounds, use spaces instead. For the verb compound, it marks that 2 chars after are still part of the verb. For adjective/adverb, its reversed, it marks that the 2 chars prior were in fact an adjective. The parsing of this is mostly up to context, it simply clarifies what someone meant should it become confusing. If there is space for spaces, one may use them. \n\n\\-There are quarter and half width spaces one can use. This means chars don't always align in rows/columns neatly. Diacritics then, if used tend to use this quarter or half width as well.\n\n\\-There are times when the ''prepositions'' (I call them relationship markers) may be placed AFTER the thing they're marking, if it's clear from context and allows one to use less characters.\n\n\\-One may also place specific classifiers in between instead. Normally, a classifier goes in front of the character. These include things like ''Quality of doing'' ''quality of experiencing'', etc.\n\n\\-reminder: agents/roles/identities, tangible entities and spaces, get their own chars. But more abstract, general actions, do not gain their own adjective, adverb, noun, verb equivalents. This depends on usage and grammar.  However, the above has a new implication where we don't always need to use modifiers to know whether something is an adjective if its clear from the conversation. \n\n Take this rather contrived example sentence. Me | Investigating | Journalism. Would be interpereted as ''I investigate journalism'' (so you investigate the concept of it). In casual speech, where chars may be dropped it clear from context, Me | Liking | Investigating | Journalism. Would be interpreted as ''I like investigative journalism''.  While ''Me | liking (auxillary) | Investigating | Journalism. Would always be ''I like to investigate journalism''. \n\n\\-Sidenote: Parts of things will typically not gain their own characters unless common, basic, important, standout, or a general word to generally describe parts. Most parts of things will be considered technical terminology, depending on whatever the group of speakers settles on, rather than having the official governing body of this standardized language get in the way.  So ones that might get a char include things like: Bricks. Pedals. Lid. Leg (can be used for anything resembling that role, like table leg), Engine, handle, Feelers (of an insect), stinger (of an insect), Wings, etc. But ''The hindwing of a butterfly'' will be terminology, it will not be its own unique character. \n\n\\----------------------\n\nI think that's about all I can think of! Again sorry for my mental breakdowns and I hope it's interesting!  \n",

My parents and sister went to Atlanta, Georgia to go see my brother graduate from boot camp graduation. They stayed there for a week and I had to stay because we have 2 dogs and I had to take care of them.\n\nKing- a bulldog (Rest his soul) \n\nLucky- a Shih tzu mix (still alive and well) \n\n\nIt was around 12:30 AM and King was already with me per usual since he loved being around me and enjoys sleeping with me. He was just about ready for bed. I turn off all the lights in my house, locked all doors, and made sure every window was locked shut. I walk in my room and I’m just hanging out watching an episode of a series before bed, and I notice that lucky isn’t in my room. \n\n“Lucky come” I say with my door open and all the lights off outside of my room. He’s a very obedient dog and whatever I tell him to do he always listens, but this time he wasn’t listening.. \n\nSo I get up from the futon, king is already asleep so I’m not worried about him. KEEP IN MIND I walk out and look for him without turning on any lights, the only light on is from my room so the light shines from a distance. \n\n\n“Lucky let’s go to bed” I said to lucky looking at him, I look to my right and lucky is looking at me tilting my head, kind of letting me know “I’m right here ?” \n\nMy heart drops and I look back to my left and there it is. The dark figure with yellow eyes. Without hesitation I grab lucky and run to my room and place him with king. \n\nI was frozen for a minute because I’m home alone and growing up I’ve always seen things, but not to this extent. \n\nI say fuck it and grab my baseball bat and turn on every single light on as I’m running, passing each light switch. \n\nI turn on the living room light and it was gone. I searched everywhere and double checked everything.. it just disappeared. \n\nI was genuinely afraid to sleep so I stayed up until I closed my eyes. \n\nI wonder what that figure was. I never saw it again.\n",

She has always had pretty regular poops, and occasionally will throw up empty belly bile in the morning if she doesn't eat enough. We took her to the vet for the diarrhea and they said her pancreas was fine and her stool sample was normal. She rarely goes unmonitored, is leashed at all times outside, and did not eat anything as far as we were concerned. It was very random diarrhea and we did not find a cause. They gave her pro pectalin every 8 hours, a probiotic for once a day, and a medication that we gave her through a syringe every 12 hours (cannot recall the name). We did this for a week and she stopped having diarrhea very quickly. It's going on 4 or so days since we stopped the pro pectalin and squeeze (she still has a few pro biotics) and I feel like she has yet to return to a normal pooping schedule. Is this normal? She tends to poop now once a day in the late afternoon, when she used to poop twice a day on schedule. I would also say her appetite seems a bit lacking but not gone completely, just irregular. The poops are larger now that it's once and fairly soft. Not diarrhea, just soft. Not sure if I should be concerned or if it is normal to experience a change after a week of that medication? When should I be concerned about the change and taking her back to the vet? They said soon, but I'm not sure if I should give her stomach more time to reset. ",

I am talking about dirty dishes all over counter directly above the EMPTY dishwasher, sinks so filthy I wouldn't let a dog drink out of it if it had water in it, glass beer bottles lined up on the kitchen floor (LL), delivery boxes (RM), filthy kitchen floor/countertops etc, filthy main bathroom (RM misses the toilet type stuff), soap scum, puffs of dust bunnies and his curly hair all over the floor, AROUND the garbage can, not in it, carpets that haven't been vacuumed  for the whole time I was ill, kitchen floor not swept or mopped and I can't handle much more.  I WILL NOT clean either of their bedrooms or the master bath.  (EWEEEE). But everyone is saying \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth\". It's not like I live here for free!  I'm on full disability due to health, both physical and mental health reasons.  I try and survive on less than $1500 per month.  I'm not here to complain about that!  The problem is, in my area, about 30 miles south of Seattle, the rent on a 1 bedroom apartment, and not a very nice one, is $1,350 per month.  Hell, a studio is $1,250 per month.  I am very grateful to at least have a roof over my head, but I feel at this point I am being taken advantage of and treated more like an unpaid live-in housekeeper/cook.  I looked up how much the average salary for a live in housekeeper is in my area and was SHOCKED to find that the \"Average Monthly Pay: $5,257\" !!! (Directly taken from Internet research).  Would I be overreacting or even overreaching to say ok, this is what it would cost, conservatively, to live in my area so I would like at least $2,000 in \"wages\".?  Please, any advise or thoughts are very welcome!! Thanks for reading. ",

          "Post Text": "Here is a little backstory on my problem fur child - he is almost 2 and we got him and his brother as puppies. (I learned about littermate syndrome so for the most part we were good about allowing them to be individuals and have never had any issues because of them being from same litter)  I am very aware of the working dog inside of them so we try to play fetch as much as possible and they run together in my yard all day long! \n\nAbout six months ago I began to allow them to spend most of the days outside as we have an invisible dog fence. They love being outside so much I have been contemplating just building them kennels or a shelter outside for bedtime since they only really come inside anymore at bedtime. (Which they seem to love so I have been hesitant on having them sleep in an outdoor kennel)\n\nRiver has always jumped up an although not preferred… and he is about 50 pounds. We didn’t completely curb the habit and I am so regretful. Now when I let him out of his kennel in the morning to go straight outside he begins to jump up as high as possibly (literally as to the point where he nips my hair) \n\nHowever now we are at a point where he keeps jumping up and jumping up and getting worked up to where he will start to get VERY ROUGH and become semi aggressive. I would love to post a video because it is the strangest thing. I don’t know how to fix this! 😭I have raised several Australian shepherds (all mostly from the same family) so i’m not sure why he’s giving me so much trouble. His poor brother will get sort of upset he’s doing that to me and then he starts to try to get between us. They never fight so it’s fine I just am so worried because I don’t want him to attack me and I would never get rid of him for this when it is my fault as I have let the jumping behavior go on for so long! (Keep in mind they only do this to me and not my partner, he can just give them a look and they are running for the hills - He has never been abusive, he has just always been the stern one. It’s just becoming such an issue because I work from home so I am the one alone with them most of the time! If he is home he can quickly get him to stop jumping on me like that in a matter of seconds. Any help would be appreciated! I am not looking for a magic solution, vet advice or actual dog training advice but any information is appreciated and welcomed 💗 I was just mostly curious if anyone has dealt with something like this, or how I could become more like my partner in the aspect that they do not jump on me! I think that would really fix it because he never is actually aggressive - it’s more like he gets way too worked up. (I have tried ignoring the behavior, which seems to make it worse)\n",

He's also a great 'guard dog' in that he barks at strangers and alerts us to people nearby.  He's also super patient and tolerant of our small kids (ages 2-6).  \n\nI have always wanted a Great Pyrenees because they possess many of the traits I'd want in a dog, but I'd prefer a mix because we don't own a farm (we do have half an acre of fenced yard though) and I also heard their trainability is difficult, specifically recall is horrible and that's one of the many things I appreciate about our current dog.  \n\nI have found some adoptable puppies in my state (two separate litters) one is a mix of mainly GSD with some GP &amp; a tiny bit of Husky mixed in.  The other is GP and Golden mix.  \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with similar mixes who can provide some overall insight?

I have looked through the yard and can't find anything that would be scaring her or making her afraid to be outside.\n\nAlso, when I clean it up, I point it out to her, like \"what's this?\" and then make her go outside and I tell her \"go potty outside\" but that hasn't seemed to be helpful.

          "Post Text": "I’m not sure if it is safe to talk about this here but I’m just going to start right off the bat to rip the Band-Aid off: I am having a hard time keeping from watching pornography. As a wife and as a Christian, I know it’s wrong to think about. I also know and understand that it’s not my husband’s fault but my own. We have two different libidos in the first place and we only have sex maybe once a month, when he’s in the mood. Part of the reason why we (especially him) don’t want to do it as often is because we don’t want to have kids yet. Even with condoms, we still are trying to be very careful. Although I was on birth control at one point, and it did make me sick , he told me he no longer wanted me on it because it could mess up my system., yet , he has made it very clear he doesn’t want any children right now. It’s a little pointless to be on them anyways because we don’t do it often. He goes back-and-forth from time to time, saying that if we have them now it wouldn’t be a big deal, and then the next second he’s paranoid and expresses how much he wants to save more money, which is understandable… We just bought a house and we’re slowly trying to make it more of a home with fixing some little repairs. I understand he’s going through a lot with working a lot and trying to keep up mentally with his place in our lives, as am I with working and being available and etc..\n\nBut I just don’t remember it being this way before we married… there is almost a 180’ with how things are turning out with our relationship… we used to be like best friends…\n\nAnother part of where I am with this is how I feel as though I get the leftovers of his time and energy. He’s very close to his family(his mother, his father, his brother), something I’ve always admired. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a tad jealous of how much attention he shows to them. Even when it comes to plans., if they have last minute plans that includes wanting him to be in, he will drop his own plans or our plans to center around them. There’s kind of a long story with where I am in these scenarios, but to make it short enough, I will say that whatever they want it goes and if I don’t like it or if I have concerns or if I’m not included/clued in the details, it’s either my problem or I’m making things a big deal and I need to “be the bigger person”/“stop overthinking”.\n\nHe has tried to include me into everything they do and I have always shown up in the past, but there has been an instance where it has been brought to my attention by someone in his family of how I’m someone interfering with their relationship and that I need to be watched because they always have to look out for him…. There have been some deceitful things happened, and there are things that I can’t unsee or understand feel… I’ve been to therapy myself few times… And things are now a little better between me and his folks with boundaries that I’ve put in place.\n\nbut I try to communicate numerous times with him but each time he is apparently clueless of what’s happening and he will apologize for how I feel… we “talk” about going to therapy together, but when I ask when we should start, he doesn’t have an answer… when I make suggestions on who to go to, suddenly he wants to go to a specific kind (has to be a man, has to be Christian based, etc), yet there hasn’t been much effort—\n\nI’ll leave that there.\n\nJust as I’ve mentioned with how I feel that our relationship has turned a 180, one example is that any time I try to connect with him or talk to him or share something funny with him, he’s tired, or will NOW as of recent month, have no problem bluntly telling me he “doesn’t care” and will walk off to go do something else. This has never happened before. But he will talk on the phone about any and everything with his family including Ideas about how we should decorate the house, what furniture they have given us and more to give us and ideas on where to set it., what renovations we should do with one room and another, &amp; etc. when it’s brought up to me, it’s just an afterthought. When I expressed that I don’t feel much involved because it feels like it’s only his house with only his ideas and whomever he considers to take advice from, he doesn’t seem to get it or will start the cycle of being clueless and then apologizing for how I feel, and then talks of therapy.\n\nBut when I pull away and let him have his space and  let him have it his way, and I find shows to watch or I’m on my phone, or something else to do, then all of a sudden I’m being “problematic” or “distant”  to him or, as he says, he thinks I don’t want to be here., even though I feel as though he doesn’t want me here… He either has the better idea, or will steal my ideas and make it his own, or will constantly tell me what someone else said would be a good fit/idea for us.\n\nI have even apologized and self reflected, and have included that I may need to make connections outside of our relationship, and go out more, because that is something that I have actually lost since dating him., trying to always be available for him and being at his back and call, or being his puppy dog.  Maybe I’m being codependent and have unrealistic expectations…  I asked him if there’s anything he needed from me or if I need to show up in a way he needs me to, but he says there’s nothing I’m doing wrong, and that he loves me for who I am….\n\nI go to the gym and do volunteer work and have rekindled some lost relationships/friendships, but sometimes I will cancel because he’ll talk me out of it or will sabotage in some way, or I’ll be too exhausted from doing things to keep up with him…. I’m trying not to sound nitpicky or that I don’t appreciate him, because I do from the bottom of my heart, I love him… I just don’t want to be taken for granted either… I don’t know… I’m running in circles with this post but: point is:\n\nWe don’t have sex, we don’t connect anymore, and he doesn’t seem to care at all as long as his needs are met. I contribute to our savings —that only he has direct access to— not as much as him, but it is still needed as back up., everything is in his name besides my phone., I don’t want to sound negative or that I have fear/doubt of our relationship, but I definitely feel cornered, a bit isolated, and lonely.",

I'm trying to install linux on my desktop since I have grown tired of the sluggish windows experience, but the fact is that the distros that I tried (Debian, Linux Mint XFCE 22 and LMDE 6, and even Puppy Linux) have shown the same problem: they all freeze after some minutes. With Linux Mint XFCE 22, i can't even install it because it always freezes after 10 minutes. With Debian and Mint LMDE 6, it always freezes after 30 minutes (i installed Debian and only GNOME could last 30 minutes, XFCE lasted only 10, and Mint LMDE only lasts for around 30 minutes too). I know it's not hardware limitation because the system is very responsive and even Puppy Linux works fine until it freezes completely, too. Windows 10 works fine, I can make heavy usage of it and even play games (under my hardware specs, of cource). But I don't want Windows, please help!  \nOne more thing, I have yet to test the distros in a VM to see if it acts the same way. ",

She's mostly scared of strangers and takes a really long time to start trusting them enough to be more comfortable\n\nShe gives clear signs of \"I'm not liking this\", tucked tail, low head and ears, turning her head away not to be touched, hiding behind us, but even with that and me saying clearly that she doesn't like interacting with strangers, some idiots insist on trying to pet her... She escalates until she snaps at them and starts barking loudly, then I have to pick her and take her somewhere else to unwind\n\nI always ask people not to interact with her when they get close to us, and if the stranger only talks to me she sits besides me and ignores them completely, but twice now a person kept harassing her even after she hid behind me... Really, someone could come and hug me and she wouldn't react, she just want NOT TO BE TOUCHED\n\nSo for her safety I got her a muzzle, but it's bothering me a lot how she looks with it, she tries to remove it and due to her anatomy she loses some visibility and bumbs into stuff\n\nIt's infuriating to expect the dog to just accept being handled by a stranger that is making them uncomfortable, hell, I want to punch strangers that touch me even when I try to move away as well\n\nI wish people would just listen to me when I ask them to leave my dog alone...

I pay rent, do lighthouse keeping in the common areas and cook at least 2x per week using my own money to purchase the food that ALL 3 of us then eat.  The problem here is that both of my \"roommates\" , father (70M) aka \"landlord=LL\") and son (36M=RM) seem to think that living like slobs is a way of life. When I first moved in it took me 3 days to get this place to even look inhabitable for a human. A little over a year ago I got extremely ill and was bed bound for about 7 months until it got so bad that I ended up in the hospital for 30 days. After I was released, I came back and the house looked like a tornado + hurricane + pack rats hit it. And I'm not just talking things laying around. I am talking about dirty dishes all over counter directly above the EMPTY dishwasher, sinks so filthy I wouldn't let a dog drink out of it if it had water in it, glass beer bottles lined up on the kitchen floor (LL), delivery boxes (RM), filthy kitchen floor/countertops etc, filthy main bathroom (RM misses the toilet type stuff), soap scum, puffs of dust bunnies and his curly hair all over the floor, AROUND the garbage can, not in it, carpets that haven't been vacuumed  for the whole time I was ill, kitchen floor not swept or mopped and I can't handle much more.  I WILL NOT clean either of their bedrooms or the last bath.  (EWEEEE). But everyone is saying \"don't look a gift horse in the mouth\". It's not like I live here for free!  I'm on full disability due to health, both physical and mental health reasons.  I try and survive on less than $1500 per month.  I'm not here to complain about that!  The problem is, in my area, about 30 miles south of Seattle, the rent on a 1 bedroom apartment, and not a very nice one, is $1,350 per month.  Hell, a studio is $1,250 per month.  I am very grateful to at least have a roof over my head, but I feel at this point I am being taken advantage of and treated more like an unpaid live-in housekeeper/cook.  I looked up how much the average salary for a live in housekeeper is in my area and was SHOCKED to find that the \"Average Monthly Pay: $5,257\" !!! (Directly taken from Internet research).  Would I be overreacting or even overreaching to say ok, this is what it would cost, conservatively, to live in my area so I would like at least $2,000 in \"wages\".?

About ninety percent of the time he tries to jump at a car that passes us and smashes his face against my rear view window. I have exhausted the valuable food rewards in the car, I have even used his positive marker (yes) when he looks in the cars direction (pre-attack).

Quite a few were simply due to me burning out in this final stretch and taking risks that I didn't need to or misreading trainers teams.\n\n**Ultra Necrozma, Elite Four &amp; Champion**\n\n\\- Ultra Necrozma was surprisingly easy thanks to focus sash Topsy-Turvy Malamar into a 1 hit by Zeus.\n\n\\- Molayne was the easiest E4 member, Misty Terrain from Zeus to prevent Paralysis allowed for safe setup and sweep by Ra.\n\n\\- Olivia's lead Armaldo didn't have the damage to prevent 2 swords dances into 1 hit by Anubis, but Thunder wave from Probopass meant that I couldn't safely sweep past it due to a paralysis on Gigalith, Fernir and Zeus double teamed for the kill before Puppy got sent out and immediately killed by her Z-Move. Fernir was able to return and roost until Stone Edge Missed so he could finish her last 2 mons.\n\n\\- Acerola also interrupted by attempted sweep thanks to screech and shadow claw knocking Zeus too low to safely continue. Ra set up a single quiver dance before he broke out of confusion and I went with it to sweep the rest of her team.\n\n\\- Puppy's death on Olivia meant I had to improvise, Fernir taking out her lead. Then Flatter giving Zeus the boost needed to 1 hit Mandibuzz. Fernir came back in to 1v1 Hawlucha and chip Toucannon for Zeus to finish. Syl finished the fight with Psychic.\n\n\\- Champion fight was even easier than Molayne with Ra setting up and sweeping the whole team himself.\n\n**Deaths:**\n\n\\- Aurora (Amarua) first serious death, she got pursuit trapped during the first Gladion fight as I thought she was a bit tankier.\n\n\\- Horje (Mudbray) no stamina so I'm not too broken up about it, she went down in 1 hit to Totem Marowak.\n\n\\- Aquiette (Brionne) a low roll tricked me into believing she could tank a hit but got crit by Totem Marowak.\n\n\\- Dancer (Oricorio) Screech plus Solar Blade from Totem Lurantis took her out.\n\n\\- Mikey (Primeape) Bounce and Steel wing during the Totem Togedemaru fight after knocking it low.\n\n\\- Aussie (Komala) had to be sacrificed to get sleep on Totem Togedemaru and Skarmory.\n\n\\- Petal (Tsareena) somehow got outsped by a trainers Honchcrow just before Totem Mimikyu\n\n\\- Helios (Anorith) Died to the same Honchcrow in 1 hit, if not for Chomps Intimidate might have lost the run.\n\n\\- Sol (Staryu) Veteran Angus hit much harder than I was expecting and I had to sac.\n\n\\- Della (Skarmory) got revenge for Sol but went down to rough skin.\n\n\\- Dryad (Lurantis) I really have a problem with getting double teamed during double battles.\n\n\\- Lisa (Salazzle) Can someone explain how Guzma's Pinsir outsped Salazzle with a +speed nature?\n\n\\- Sailor (Pelipper) Crit Air Slash during the Aether Guzma fight.\n\n\\- Wimpy (Golisopod) I forgot that sucker punch has higher priority than First Impression.\n\n\\- Chomps (Mawile) Had to be sacrificed for a safe switch on Lusamine's Milotic.\n\n\\- Bandit (Scrafty) had to be thrown out on Milotic after Lusamine threw by going for Icy wind on Anubis then flail? Which wouldn't have killed Anubis but meant I had to sacrifice Bandit to prevent a death on switching back in.\n\n\\- Lily (Ninetales) Earthquake Crit through Aurora veil in Vast Poni Canyon.\n\n\\- Big Boss (Murkrow) Sac on Mina Ribombee for a safe pivot cause I forgot to change my team after Ultra Necrozma.\n\n\\- Bomb (Graveler) died to Pelipper during Totem Ribombee trying to explode.\n\n\\- Alora (Tyranitar) I forgot about Z-moves and got him killed during Hapu Kahuna fight.",

More than she’s been through her entire teenager phase. Just causing trouble whenever she feels like it - and maintaining eye contact when she does it like she KNOWS she’s being a menace. She’s super friendly but incredibly over excited with other dogs and people. We are working on this through lots of training and every now and then I can see her trying to control herself to varying degrees of success. But ultimately the unhinged queen of chaos reigns.\n\nIs it normal for an extra regression at 18 months? It’s been a couple weeks of this and I really don’t want this to be the normal. Please tell me it gets better and when 😭 I thought we were already in the rebellious phase but it’s suddenly gotten worse. She’s spayed as of a couple months ago.",

I’m a native Northern Virginian, girl dad of one daughter, dog father to three adorable Boston Terriers, and a lifelong pop-culture fiend who’s spent the last 15 years writing for the Nation’s Newspaper. I review movies, rank pretty much everything from Marvel movies to football films, and sometimes get to talk with the likes of Stephen King and George Clooney.\n\nOne of my best movie memories from when I was a kid was in 1983, when I was 7. My mom picked me up from school for opening night of “Return of the Jedi.” There was a line around the mall, and we had to wait for two hours, but Jabba the Hutt, Ewoks and Admiral Ackbar were so worth it.\n\nMy list, ranked worst to best:\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/06/20/best-summer-blockbuster-movies-ranked/84056437007/\n\nGet some popcorn and let’s dive into the world of summer movies — ask me anything!

          "Post Text": "To make a long story short, I have a 2009 Honda Accord V6 with 135k that should probably go away soon because of the cost of repairs building up. I test drove a few things, but was utterly underwhelmed because I realized I have been used to driving faster cars and fast responding cars. So I need help choosing. Below is a comprehensive list of cars I have driven and liked, and why. I owe nothing on the Accord and would use it as a down payment, and hopefully still get something good out of it. As for a car payment, I can afford $500 a month. I also need something that's faster. I live in Texas with all these speed demons, and the Accord's agility has definitely saved my ass quite a few times.\n\nTo get it out of the way, different members of the family have the entire XC line from Volvo. I like the 2025 XC60 B5 AWD the best out of anything I've ever been in, but I'm not stupid; that is way out of my price range. I like how fast it moves, the safety features, and the responsiveness of the brakes. Next would be the 2020 XC40 T5 AWD, same as the XC60 but a bit lighter, so you have to manage acceleration more, I've found. Lastly, my mom is a certified trophy wife, so she has a 2021 XC90 T6 Inscription. The sports mode is glorious, but the car feels like a boat, and I'm not towing around 3 children and 2 dogs. \n\nNext would be the 2017 Ford Explorer XLT, mileage is kinda meh but damn that thing can move and I think its responsiveness is comparable to the XC60. As far as I know, the only repairs on the one I've driven (also family owned) were all cosmetic, and so far, so good on everything else. \n\nI've been in a 2013 F-150 XLT, and that was also fun, but it kinda had the same feeling as the XC90, and is too big for me. The most out-of-left-field vehicle I enjoyed was a 2010 Dodge Dakota that my best friend has. It was a little sluggish, but it also has 190k miles on it, so that's expected. I also really enjoy the Jettas from VW. Lastly, I test drove a Subaru 2025 Crosstrek Premium, and though it was on the slow side, its features are comparable to the Volvos, and the thought of owning that car for upwards of 15 years is hard to pass up. I'm looking at another one soon. \n\nI haven't been in a Camry, and I know I need to. \n\nAs for dislikes, the 2023 Mazda3, 2025 Civic, 2015 Chevy Traverse, and the 2017 Yukon Denali XL (my grandpa retired, can you really blame him?). I found all of these cars to be a bit too slow for me, the Civic was too bland for the price, and the Traverse just feels weird. And, of course, the Denali was just a hazard. ",

They are both mixed-breed dogs and weigh no more than 10 kg.\n\nOlly has never given us any problems. However, no matter how hard we try, Arya still urinates and defecates in the house EVERY day, even in places like the sofa, the beds, and her own bed... She doesn't let you know when she wants to go out; she just does it wherever she wants.\n\nWe've tried everything; from taking her for walks every hour, taking her to the vet several times, and even taking her to two ethologists, but in these seven years, we haven't seen any improvement. In fact, things are getting worse, as today she does everything in the house, even going out 10 times a day...\n\nNow this has become a BIG PROBLEM, as a few months ago we had a daughter and she's just starting to crawl... We tried buying a playpen for the dog, but the moment you put her inside she starts barking for hours, disturbing the neighbors...\n\nWhat can we do? I have my daughter in a playpen without letting her explore, while the dog is free in the living room, urinating and defecating wherever she pleases... This morning when we woke up there were several pees (one of them on the sofa) and three piles of poop... The living room was a real mess and smelled terrible.\n\nWe don't want to get rid of her, but it's hell living like this...",

The issue with this is my beagle can open the lever doors. We used to crate but he figured out how to escape his crate but in our old apartment things were fine because we didn’t have lever doors.\n\nYesterday my dog escaped the house while I was at work leaving the back door to the house open. My dog was at risk and so was my house. \n\nI am looking for advice/reassurance because my only solution was to crate my dog but add a padlock and zip ties to keep him in and then try my best to barricade the bedroom door. Is this going to work? What can I do in the meantime while I wait for the landlord to install a deadbolt on the back door to keep my dog from escaping? ",

We might lost her and your baby dog Sophie has gone through the rainbow but there are a lot of silver linings right now. \n\nLook, your Sophie doesn't have to hurt anymore and fight for that gruelling sickness she had. We had the means to give her the best life, gave her complete medical needs and sent her off properly. We fought bravely and we were given time to say farewell. We are lucky. \n\nDada will no longer comeback you know that. But look, you can now properly focus your time chasing your dreams. UP student na in a few months. Tagal mo nang pangarap to diba? How lucky we are to chase our potential. \n\nNext month, promoted ka na. You know what is more lucky? Di ka pa officially promoted for this new position pero nakalign up ka na for another promotion. Sino ka dyan?? \n\nSobrang blessed natin and sobrang fullfilled. \n\nLooking back, alam mo naman hindi ready kayo ni Dada to be in a relationship. Parehas pa kayong healing galing that time. But we got to thank her for teaching us how peaceful and gentle love should be. Ganoon pala dapat yun no? We can only hope that she is happy na rin as well. \n\nSo come hell and high water, we will make it through. When the second promotion comes at super stable ka na, you'll eventually meet the love of your life. \n\nGood luck, Baks. Alam mong di ka magiging single for too long kasi malandi ka.

The before-work crowd was still streaming in, corporate-looking men and corporate-looking women hurriedly ordering coffees and sandwiches at the counter before rushing to the office.\n\nJo and I sat in our usual booth, tucked away in the corner of the room and pressed up against a large street-side window. Jo liked to watch as people scurried about on their way to work, and she’d said that sitting by the window was the only way to do it fairly, so that they could watch us too.\n\nThe nine-o-clock sun was spilled across our table, warming us on an otherwise chilly February morning.\n\nJo stuffed her cigarette into the ashtray which sat between our coffees and smiled at me.\n\n“What was she like?”\n\nHer question startled me.\n\nIt had seemed some sort of unwritten law between us to never speak of it.\n\nThat being said, it was the anniversary of the whole damned thing. Seven years. It hardly seemed possible.\n\nHad Jo known that, or was her asking just a strange coincidence? I guessed I’d shared the date with her at some point, during a long-ago conversation in a distant, forgotten corner.\n\nI cleared my throat. Jo continued to smile toward me.\n\n“If you don’t want to talk about her, it’s okay.”\n\n“Um,” I managed.\n\n“No, really, it’s okay.” She took a small sip from her mug, momentarily looking away.\n\nI suddenly felt warm all over. The heat rose from my chest to my head and went back down again, with no way to get out.\n\nIt’s a funny thing to lose someone when you’re young and invincible, and twenty-seven is still that, and then to be thirty-four and still somewhat broken, but mended, so that the scar yet shows under the right lighting but doesn’t hurt so much anymore.\n\nI didn’t know how to respond. It had been so long since I’d last talked about her.\n\n“I’m sorry, Jack. Really, forget I even brought it up.”\n\nThe sunlight glistened off of Jo’s wedding band, still new and mostly un-scuffed, blinding my eyes and turning everything amber.\n\nI remembered much about her, but the memories were no longer clear, like old video tape that had been worn out and recorded over.\n\nThere were smiles and tears and laughter and arguments and forgiveness, over and over again, all unspooled and jumbled up together.\n\nI saw once-familiar places and old friends and long drives home and her leaning out of the sun-roof of my dad’s car, shouting at the moon and laughing hard, and that CD was probably still in there somewhere, tucked under the passenger seat forever.\n\nThere was sneaking through my bedroom window and fumbling around in the dark and falling in love and heading off to college but still making it work.\n\nI remembered that first apartment together when there was no money, and then suddenly a lot of it, but nothing different between the two of us expect for the growing wrinkles around our eyes and my hair growing thinner, and there was a dog named for a movie we liked and a view of the city and a candle always lit on the dining room table.\n\nAnd then there was none of it.\n\nSuddenly and abruptly and unfairly and foully, but there was nothing that could be done about that now.\n\nHer mom and dad, and mine were already gone, and her brothers and sisters that had become my own but were no longer, and all of those friends were ours together and it wasn’t right to have them on my own so I didn’t anymore.\n\nNothing to be done about it but continuing to move forward and smiling through it all and working to forget and trying not to remember.

As a wife and as a Christian, I know it’s wrong to think about. I also know and understand that it’s not my husband’s fault but my own. \nWe have two different libidos in the first place and we only have sex maybe once a month, when he’s in the mood. Part of the reason why we (especially him) don’t want to do it as often is because we don’t want to have kids yet. Even with condoms, we still are trying to be very careful. Although I was on birth control at one point, and it did make me sick , he told me he no longer wanted me on it because it could mess up my system., yet , he has made it very clear he doesn’t want any children right now. It’s a little pointless to be on them anyways because we don’t do it often. He goes back-and-forth from time to time, saying that if we have them now it wouldn’t be a big deal, and then the next second he’s paranoid and expresses how much he wants to save more money, which is understandable… We just bought a house and we’re slowly trying to make it more of a home with fixing some little repairs. I understand he’s going through a lot with working a lot and trying to keep up mentally with his place in our lives, as am I with working and being available and etc.. \n\nBut I just don’t remember it being this way before we married… there is almost a 180’ with how things are turning out with our relationship… we used to be like best friends… \n\nAnother part of where I am with this is how I feel as though I get the leftovers of his time and energy. \nHe’s very close to his family(his mother, his father, his brother), something I’ve always admired. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a tad jealous of how much attention he shows to them. Even when it comes to plans., if they have last minute plans that includes wanting him to be in, he will drop his own plans or our plans to center around them. There’s kind of a long story with where I am in these scenarios, but to make it short enough, I will say that whatever they want it goes and if I don’t like it or if I have concerns or if I’m not included/clued in the details, it’s either my problem or I’m making things a big deal and I need to “be the bigger person”/“stop overthinking”. \n\nHe has tried to include me into everything they do and I have always shown up in the past, but there has been an instance where it has been brought to my attention by someone in his family of how I’m someone interfering with their relationship and that I need to be watched because they always have to look out for him…. There have been some deceitful things happened, and there are things that I can’t unsee or understand feel… I’ve been to therapy myself few times…\nAnd things are now a little better between me and his folks with boundaries that I’ve put in place. \n\nbut I try to communicate numerous times with him but each time he is apparently clueless of what’s happening and he will apologize for how I feel… we “talk” about going to therapy together, but when I ask when we should start, he doesn’t have an answer… when I make suggestions on who to go to, suddenly he wants to go to a specific kind (has to be a man, has to be Christian based, etc), yet there hasn’t been much effort—\n\nI’ll leave that there.\n\n\n\nJust as I’ve mentioned with how I feel that our relationship has turned a 180, one example is that any time I try to connect with him or talk to him or share something funny with him, he’s tired, or will NOW as of recent month, have no problem bluntly telling me he “doesn’t care” and will walk off to go do something else. This has never happened before. But he will talk on the phone about any and everything with his family including Ideas about how we should decorate the house, what furniture they have given us and more to give us and ideas on where to set it., what renovations we should do with one room and another, &amp; etc. when it’s brought up to me, it’s just an afterthought. When I expressed that I don’t feel much involved because it feels like it’s only his house with only his ideas and whomever he considers to take advice from, he doesn’t seem to get it or will start the cycle of being clueless and then apologizing for how I feel, and then talks of therapy. \n\nBut when I pull away and let him have his space and  let him have it his way, and I find shows to watch or I’m on my phone, or something else to do, \nthen all of a sudden I’m being “problematic” or “distant”  to him or, as he says, he thinks I don’t want to be here., \neven though I feel as though he doesn’t want me here… \nHe either has the better idea, or will steal my ideas and make it his own, or will constantly tell me what someone else said would be a good fit/idea for us.\n\n\nI have even apologized and self reflected, and have included that I may need to make connections outside of our relationship, and go out more, because that is something that I have actually lost since dating him., trying to always be available for him and being at his back and call, or being his puppy dog.  Maybe I’m being codependent and have unrealistic expectations…  I asked him if there’s anything he needed from me or if I need to show up in a way he needs me to, but he says there’s nothing I’m doing wrong, and that he loves me for who I am….\n\nI go to the gym and do volunteer work and have rekindled some lost relationships/friendships, but sometimes I will cancel because he’ll talk me out of it or will sabotage in some way, or I’ll be too exhausted from doing things to keep up with him…. \nI’m trying not to sound nitpicky or that I don’t appreciate him, because I do from the bottom of my heart, I love him… \nI just don’t want to be taken for granted either… \nI don’t know… \nI’m running in circles with this post but:\npoint is: \n\nWe don’t have sex, we don’t connect anymore, and he doesn’t seem to care at all as long as his needs are met. \nI contribute to our savings —that only he has direct access to— not as much as him, but it is still needed as back up., everything is in his name besides my phone., I don’t want to sound negative or that I have fear/doubt of our relationship, but I definitely feel cornered, a bit isolated, and lonely. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I’m a junior in college living off campus in a really dog-friendly area, and I’ve been seriously thinking about getting an emotional support dog (ESA, not a service dog).\n\nThis came up with my therapist after I dog-sat and cat-sat for a friend earlier this year (about a week each). \n\nIt honestly made such a difference. When I had the dog, I felt more stable, more social, and way more motivated day to day. My therapist agrees that having an ESA could really help support my mental health in the long term.\n\nSo here’s where I’m at:\n\nI’ve got a remote part-time job and a pretty relaxed school schedule. \n\nI live walking distance from campus, so I can easily head home between classes if I need to let a dog out. \n\nI’ve been saving for a while with this in mind, and I’ve talked a lot with my family about it. They’re really supportive and have offered to help with vet bills or any emergencies if I ever run into trouble; even after I graduate. \n\nI’m planning to move back home for a bit after college while job searching, and I’ve already done a few internships in marketing and comms, so I feel like I’m in a pretty stable place to take this on (or as stable as one can be in this job market Jesus.) \n\n\nTDLR;\nIf you have any advice or experiences, I’d love to hear them:\nHave you had an ESA, or do you know someone who has?\nAny tips on how to choose the right dog, especially while in college?\nWhat breeds or temperaments tend to do best in this kind of lifestyle?\nAnything you wish you’d known before getting your dog?\n\nLiterally any insight is welcome, Thanks so much in advance :)",

My neighbor usually brings his dog there, always unleashed to play around. There has never been any issues. We’ve both been here years. My dog is always in my private terrace behind a fence. When we do go out in the common area, he is always leashed. I always avoid going out when anyone at all is there in the common area and always take him out there only at night for a quick pee before bed. But there has been many occasions, when I’m walking my dog and suddenly the neighbor’s dog comes running, barking at my dog. Usually she stops short of biting distance and I always pull my dog back, while her owner, my neighbor comes running to carry the Pomeranian back. In the back of my mind I always had this feeling that something bad could happen someday.\nYesterday, well we’re in Qatar, and there were literally missiles flying around in the sky. I came out to the common area to get a better look and my dog was with me leashed as usual. To understand, it’s a huge space with lots of plants and bushes and you can’t tell who is around. The Pomeranian was there around a corner and I didn’t see her and she came running again at my dog but this time didn’t stop short and went all in and somehow while I tried to pull my dog back, he caught her and tried to shake her. I got him to release her but by then he had bit her and she started shrieking. Meanwhile the neighbor came running too and got her and it was overall very very stressful for everyone. I mean you could hear missiles getting shot out from the sky and everyone was super scared and in the middle of it all this happened. Anyway they took her to the vet and she got some stitches, there were a couple of deep wounds. Thank God nothing worse happened. But I feel terrible. I love the small dog and play with her a lot as well. I’ve a shihtzu too and she’s best friends with the Pomeranian. I don’t know how I could have prevented it. I offered to pay for all the vet bills but I feel horrible and I don’t know how to face my neighbor anymore.",

Writing this while everything’s still locked in my head. If I wait, I’ll start minimizing things, rounding corners that shouldn’t be rounded. That’s how your brain keeps you functional when things stop making sense—it throws out what doesn’t fit the pattern. That’s dangerous.\n\nSo this is going to be longer than it needs to be, and a little messy. I’ll clean it up for the report log later.\n\nFor now: here’s everything. Exactly how it happened.\n\n**PRE-PATROL**\n\nI stepped out of the Security Hub at 02:57.\n\nThe temperature had dropped another three degrees, officially 30°F. But it felt colder. The kind of cold that doesn’t hit your skin first—it goes for your joints, like it knows where the pain already lives. My bad knee twinged the moment my boot hit gravel. That’s become my barometer for when something’s off: pain that knows things before I do.\n\nThe perimeter lights came on late.\n\nThey’re motion triggered, but the first three didn’t flicker on until I was already under them. That’s a deviation of at least a half second per unit. I clocked it. Wrote it down. The lights weren’t dim. They were… hesitant. Like they had to think about it. Same hum underfoot as always, the subterranean vibration that never quite stops—but it was slower, deeper. Like someone turned the volume down, but not the source.\n\nThe path was wrong tonight.\n\nNot visually. Just spatially. I walked the same number of steps as usual. Counted them: 42 from the Hub door to the outer airlock. But it *felt* longer. Like the land stretched a little farther while I wasn’t looking. Don’t ask me how I know that. Some things you just register in your bones.\n\n**AIRLOCK ENTRY: 02:59**\n\nThe vestibule took longer to cycle. 11 seconds instead of 8. I watched the pressure gauge blink—once, twice, pause—then complete. Might be recalibrating. Might not. When the inner door hissed open, I smelled bleach again, but only faintly this time. Like something trying to cover its tracks after it’s already too late.\n\nI stepped inside. Hallway lights activated, full brightness, instant reaction.\n\nThat’s when I saw the floor.\n\n**THE FOOTPRINTS**\n\nThere were wet spots along the corridor floor—irregular patches, not pooled, but definite. Not fresh mop water. The consistency was wrong. Slightly viscous. Almost like cleaning gel that hadn’t been diluted.\n\nI paused at the first corner—about ten meters in—and crouched.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw the **prints**.\n\nNot stains. Not boot scuffs. Actual wet footprints. Clear tread. Forefoot-heavy, pointed slightly inward. Human gait, but off-center. Left foot favored. Slight drag at toe-off.\n\nThey weren’t mine.\n\nI wear standard Client-issue hex soles. These were chevron-patterned. Mid-weight, maybe tactical work boots, size 10–11 by guess. Whoever made them was walking with intention, but not confidence. Heel spacing was inconsistent. That’s important.\n\nBecause I wasn’t alone down there. Or at least—I hadn’t been.\n\n**SUB-3 ACCESS**\n\nI followed the prints.\n\nThey moved away from the main line and stopped at the **Sub-3 Access door**. Which is supposed to be sealed.\n\nIt still is, physically. But something had changed.\n\nThere was condensation on the panel—just a trace, like a breath held too long. The seal ring had faint smudging around the perimeter. And there was a scent, almost buried under the bleach: something organic. Warm. Slightly sweet. Not rot. Not blood. But *cellular.* Like the inside of someone’s palm.\n\nThe prints stopped there. No exit trail. Which suggests the door opened and closed again after.\n\nI tapped my fob against the reader. Denied, as expected. Status: RED. No override available. I backed away, drew a boundary mark on the floor with chalk from my kit, and logged the contact time: 03:11.\n\nTurned to leave.\n\nThat’s when I saw it.\n\n**THE BADGE**\n\nHalf-tucked under the lip of a vent just past the Z-3/Utility junction was a **personnel badge**.\n\nLaminated. Scuffed. Coiled black cord twisted behind it like someone had balled it up in a pocket.\n\nIt was positioned **deliberately**, half-visible, as if left to be found.\n\nHere’s what I recorded:\n\n* Name field: **Blank.**\n* Photo field: **Fully blacked out.** Not blurred. Cross-hatched in black marker. Thick strokes. Ink bled through the plastic.\n* ID Number: M3–170–614. Cross-referenced the prefix: **Medical Research, Tier 3.** No active employees with that designation listed since the original onboarding manifest was posted in briefing.\n* Laminate condition: warped, corners curled from prolonged exposure to heat.\n* Clipped to the edge of a bent vent grate, which shows no signs of forced entry.\n\nThe badge was warm to the touch.\n\nI’m not exaggerating. I touched it with a gloved hand and felt heat through the material. Surface temp was above room temperature. I checked ambient hallway air: 65°F. The badge? Closer to 90°F. I didn’t have a thermal scanner, but I’ve carried warm gear long enough to know body heat when I feel it.\n\nAnd here’s what really rattled me:\n\nThe photo square? The marker had been **applied from the inside.** You could see the strokes under the laminate. The only way to do that is to mark the image *before* it was sealed.\n\nThat means the badge was made like that.\n\nSomeone didn’t want that face seen—not later, not ever.\n\n**THE LIGHTS**\n\nI stood up, pocketed the badge, and that’s when the lights died.\n\nNot a flicker. Not a surge. Not a transition.\n\nA full, **instant blackout**.\n\nI looked at my watch. Analog, no backlight. Tapped it. 03:27. I started counting.\n\nOne…  \nTwo…  \nThree…\n\nNothing moved. No sound. No fallback strobes. Emergency protocol is a red rotary every 20 feet. None activated.\n\n…Four.  \nFive.  \nSix.\n\nI stood still. Baton's in my hand, but it felt like dead weight. Like it didn’t matter.\n\n…Seven.  \nEight.\n\nThe walls weren’t just dark. They were **empty**. The air felt hollow. Like it was watching.\n\n…Nine.\n\nThe lights came back.  \nSnap. Full brightness. Same position. Same orientation. No delay in current. No heat pulse from the LEDs.\n\nI hadn’t moved. Nothing else had either.\n\nBut I checked the prints again. And the wet ones? The ones I’d seen?\n\nThey were gone.\n\n**RETURN TO HUB**\n\nReturned to Security Hub at 03:49. Airlock cycled without delay. Perimeter cameras are back online. Power grid shows no interruption.\n\nBut the hallway footage from 03:00 to 03:30?\n\n**Corrupted.** Just static.  \nEvery other time segment is intact.\n\nChecked my own locker out of instinct. Found nothing missing—except...\n\nMy **original Army dog tag** was gone.\n\nThe one I wear clipped inside the inside flap of my work vest. The one I **never take out.**\n\nInstead, in its place: a rusted chain with no tag attached. Just the ring.\n\nNo one could’ve gotten in. No one should’ve known it was there. No one should’ve known that tag even existed.\n\n**FINAL NOTES**\n\nENTRY: 0300 Patrol – Incident Level: **Anomalous**\n\nFINDINGS:  \n– Unauthorized ID badge recovered.  \n– Hallway lighting failure: exact 9-second blackout.  \n– Sub-3 door showed condensation, unlogged activity.  \n– Wet footprints not matching my pattern.  \n– Audio/visual recording wiped for blackout period.  \n– Personal equipment tampering confirmed.\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  \nBadge secured in lockbox. Chain logged. Report sent via encrypted dispatch. Radio channel 4 remains silent. I haven’t tried transmitting. Not yet.\n\nI’m staying awake until 0500. I won’t be doing the next patrol early. If the rules say 2300 and 0300 only, I’m not testing them.\n\nI don’t think this building *wants* you walking outside those windows.\n\nAnd whatever is using the doors… it doesn’t use keys.\n\nNext update after rest cycle.  \nAssuming I sleep.\n\nStandby.",

          "Post Text": "\nChapter 1 \n\n\nI was finally able to fall asleep after cleaning the house, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making dinner, and getting my brothers and sister to bed, not to mention getting my homework done. I have a major paper due tomorrow, and I just finished it. Getting it done with three three-year-old toddlers running around is not the easiest thing to do. I had just finally fallen into a deep slumber when I was ripped out of bed and dragged down the stairs. Damn that is going to leave a mark or two. “What the fuck is this shit?” My mother yelled at me. “Your father will be home soon, get this shit cleaned up!” She shouted, throwing me in the kitchen. “First of all, you made this mess, I had everything spotless, so you need to clean up after yourself and secondly, he’s NOT my FATHER!” I spat back. My mother reared back and slapped me so hard that she drew blood and making me fall back to the floor. I shook my head slightly trying to get my bearings back. “He IS your FATHER! Now get this shit cleaned up before he gets home.” She shrieked at and stormed out of the kitchen to her room. This isn’t the first time she has done this; she would come home and make a mess and tell him that I didn’t do any of my chores. My mom’s not as bad as he can be, he can be downright evil. He beat me so badly once that I could hardly move and of course that meant I couldn’t clean, cook, or take care of the triplets and that made things worse, and it led to another beating. I had to force myself up to get things done. Eventually I fell into a routine and was able to get everything done, even on the days when my mom came home in a bitchy mood.\n\n\n\nI was in the middle of cleaning up the mess my mom made when HE walked into the kitchen. “What is this shit? Why is nothing clean!” I heard him bellow. I was already pissed at mom, so this was not going to be good for me in the end. “It was clean until your wife got home and decided that her day wasn’t complete until she made mine into shit!” I spat; my words laced with venom. “What did you say?!” He snarled. I saw his eyes shift back and forth between his brown color to pitch black. He always did that when he got angry. “You heard me; I didn’t stutter.” I yelled at him as I finished cleaning up after my mom. “Don’t you ever speak about your mother like that!” He yelled, the next thing I knew pain was shooting down my neck. I fell to my knees grabbing the back of my head. I tried to stand but his fist cracked against the right side of my face. “You will show us some respect!” He growled out standing over me. “I told you he wouldn’t be happy.” Mom sneered. “C’mon Freddy dear, I’m tired, it’s been a long day.” She told him rubbing herself against him, that is so gross. He pulled her to his chest as she purred in his arms. She gave him her, what she calls, her sexy smile and walked out of the kitchen, swaying her hips. “I better not find any blood here in the morning. You understand?” He yelled. I didn’t answer so he repeated himself and he hated to repeat himself. “DO. YOU. UNDERSTAND.” He gritted out. “DO NOT MAKE ME REPEAT MYSELF.” He growled as he towered over me, and I nodded my head.\n\n\n\nOnce I was finally finished cleaning the kitchen, again, I went to bed, praying I could get a few hours of sleep before my alarm went off. My alarm clock went off at five a.m., I groaned and shut it off. I went to my bathroom as quietly as I could since the triplets slept in my room. I did my business, showered, brushed my teeth, and got started on trying to hide the bruises on my face. They were a little darker than usual, so I wasn’t able to cover them all the way. I did the best I could. I walked out of the bathroom to find my little ones wide awake and sitting quietly waiting for me. Fred has them trained and so scared not to cry, yell, or throw temper tantrums. He beat me in front of them when they misbehaved and told them that if they keep it up, he will do the same thing to them. It only took for them to see him beat me once and they never made a peep again. I would take a beating for them anytime; the slightest squeal of joy would throw both of into a fit of rage. Imagine that the squeal of happiness from their children makes them angry.\n\n\n\n“Stowme.” I heard Ryder call out softly. “Good morning my little loves. Did you sleep well?” I asked, helping them from their bed and placed them on the floor. They nodded their heads with yawns. “C’mon, we need to get you cleaned up and outta your jammies.” I told them as they waddled to the bathroom. Nancy never took care of them, except for the first six months after they were born she was a good mom and I thought that maybe she would change but when they turned six-month-old, she started back to work and would stay out late. Fred moved their stuff into my room and told me that they are now my problem and responsibility and that they are my kids now. By the time I got the four of us ready it was six thirty. I took them downstairs, packed their snack bags, their sippy cups, grabbed our backpacks and quietly made our way out the door. Fred and Nancy were still asleep, they slept until whenever they decided to get up. They both worked in the evening until sometime in the early morning hours, it usually worked out because we hardly ever had to see each other, unless Nancy was in one of her moods or I accidentally came face to face with one of them.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nMy first class started at eight fifteen, giving me a little over an hour to drop them off at daycare, which was on campus, run by the child development department. Since I didn’t have money to pay I explained my situation to them, well except the beatings. They were able to find a scholarship to help pay for the triplets fees, they even offered me a job to help me make some money to take care of my siblings. “Good morning, Stormie.” Mrs. Black, the director of the center, greeted. “Morning.” I chirped back. “Mowny.” The triplets greeted in unison. “Why good morning little ones. Are you ready to get your day started?” She asked them, bending down to their level. “Yesh ma’am.” They smiled. “Well come along, you can help me get things ready. Get your bags and say goodbye to mom.” They walked over to me, who they call mama, I put their backpacks on them, and they each gave me a hug and kiss and waddled off with Mrs. Black. Mrs. Black turned to me and mouthed, See ya later. I waved at Mrs. Black and made my way out. The weather was starting to change, it was getting cooler, the leaves were changing colors and that means winter break is around the corner. I hate winter break; the beatings always got worse.\n\n\n\n“Hi, what would you like?” The girl behind the counter asked with boredom. “A large hot mocha please.” I was digging through my bag looking for my wallet when the girl said, “four dollars and twenty-five cents, please.” She huffed at me. “Sorry, sorry, sorry, I have my wallet in here somewhere.” I smiled at her. “Look lady, if you can’t pay, why did you order?” “I can pay, I just can’t find my wallet.” “You’re holding up the line.” She snapped. I turned around and saw that there were six people behind me. “C’mon lady, hurry up!” Someone grunted. “Yeah, we’re gonna be late for class.” I blushed in embarrassment. “Sorry,” I said one more time and ran out. I couldn’t help it, but I started crying. As I was hurrying out, I bumped into a wall, well it felt like a wall, but it turned out to be a person a very HUGE person, a male person. I bumped into him so hard that we both dropped our things. I quickly picked up my things. “I’m so sorry.” I muttered looking at the stranger. We made eye contact and wholly shitzu, I felt like I was hit by a lightning bolt. Who is this Greek God looking back at me? He has the deepest gray eyes, shoulder length black hair and his lips, his oh so plump kissable lips. What is wrong with me? I don’t even know him, and my lower region is on fire. I heard him say, “MATE - MINE.” I gave him a confused look and then he shook his head lightly. “Are you okay?” His voice sent chills down my spine. “Umm…Yeah, I’m fine.” I answered him softly as he extended his hand to help me up. I reluctantly put my hand in his. I had no idea what happened, but I felt jolts of electricity flow through my body. He felt it also because he inhaled sharply. I pulled my hand away from his and thought I heard a low growl from him. The way he looked at me made me wish I had a change of panties. “Uh, again, sorry. I need to go. I’m gonna be late for class.” I said backing away from him. I wasn’t anywhere from being late for class, I still had at least an hour, but I couldn’t chance letting him get any ideas that I was interested in him, even though I wouldn’t mind climbing that mountain. He opened his mouth to say something, but I turned tail and ran off. What did he mean by saying, MATE MINE? I knew I could never belong to anyone, except of course to Fred, he would never let me go. Although I’m sure my mom wouldn’t mind, she wouldn’t miss us, she would be free to live her life like she wants, not that she doesn’t already. \n\n\n\nI was deep in thought when I heard someone clear their throat and ask, “Are you okay?” I looked up and saw a pretty blue eyed, perky blonde smiling at me. “Yeah, I’m fine.” I didn’t even realize I was on the ground. I grumbled in embarrassment. “It happens, here let me help you up.” She said, extending her hand. “Oh my! What happened to your face? Did someone here hurt you?” She gasped. “What?! Oooh, nothing. I’m just very clumsy, as you can see, I wasn’t paying attention and got hit by a door.” I tried to explain but the look on her face told her that she didn’t believe me. “If you’ll excuse me…\"\" I started to say. “Here, try this.” She said handing me a bottle of cover up. “C’mon, let's see if we can get this covered.” She offered. “Thanks.” I sighed as we walked into the lady’s room, and the girl applied the cover up. “By the way my name is Stormie.” I smiled faintly. “Nice to meet you, Stormie.” She smiled back at me. “I’m Summer SilverMoon, I just transferred, so today is my first day.” She replied, stood back, and admired her work. “There all covered up.” She turned me to look in the mirror. “Whoa!” I gasped. Whatever she did, she was able to cover every single bruise and cut. I need to ask her how to do that. “Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I softly said. “No problem. Would you tell me who did this to you?” She asked. I stood there in silence, no one ever asked me about my bruises. They always walked by and ignored me. “I know we just met but if you ask for help, I can help you.” Summer offered. I wanted to ask for help, but I was scared. I knew that Fred would never let me go, he would follow me to the end of the world if he had to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nWhen Summer realized that I wasn’t going to answer her she changed the subject. “So, what class are you going to? Ethics with Mr. Sheridan.” “Hey me too!” She said with excitement. “But he’s not the instructor anymore.” She said as we walked into the classroom. “What? He’s been teaching since the semester started.” I frowned. “Yeah, rumor is that he was in a car accident over the weekend, so there’s a new instructor.” She explained. How did I not know this? I asked myself. Oh yeah, three 3-year-old little terrors, my little terrors. I have no time for anything else outside of them, right now, they are my life. We walked into the classroom, and I started making my way to my normal seat at the top of the room. Summer tugged at my arm and led me to the second-row corner seats. I shook my head no. I didn’t like sitting so close, it was easier for me to stay invisible, especially when I had bruises to hide. “Summer, I’m gonna go sit up there, these seats are just too close to the front.” I said pointing to my regular seat and lowering my head. “No, please sit with me. I can’t see the board from way up there and you’re the only person I know.” Summer pouted. I groaned, I hate pouting, the triplets do it all the time, Summer reminded me of them. “Don’t pout!” I groaned at her. She kept her pout going and gave puppy dog eyes. “Uuggg…fine, okay.” I grumbled and Summer squealed in delight. I shook my head and settled into my seat as the rest of the class started making their way in. I got a few glances and stares, but I just kept my head down and chatted with Summer.\n\n\n\n“Oh, my Goddess!” A shrill voice came from behind us. Have you seen our new instructor?! She excitedly asked her friend. I rolled my eyes. “I got a peek at him and the other guy as I passed by his office on my way here.” She smirked. “They are both beyond hot and they don’t even look that much older than us. I am so going to love getting into his pants.” She smirked as she adjusted her boobs. “Such whores.” Summer snorted and I snorted out a laugh. “Excuse you! No one was talking to you or asked for your opinion. You and the invisible girl need to mind your own business.” She spit back at us. “I can say whatever I want.” “You’re the one telling the whole class what you’re THINKING will happen. I’m not here to listen to your wanna be conquests. This is not a dating service; this is a place of higher education. If you’re just here to find your mate, then I think you’re in the wrong place.” Summer coolly said. Wait?! Did Summer just say mate? This is the second time I’ve heard that word MATE, is it like the Australian people use the word MATE. I’ll have to remember to ask her about that later. “Oh puh-lease, you’re just jealous.” The girl said looking at her manicured fingers. “We can get any guy we want anytime we want.” She bragged. Summer snorted so hard that she blew her coffee out her nose. “Me jealous? Of you?” Summer snorted wiping her face. Storm couldn’t help but laugh at the whole situation and when she finally got herself together she said, “Yeah sure, keep telling yourself that Barbie doll. The only guys you will get are little boys, not MEN.” Summer said.\n\n\n\nI was still giggling when the most amazing scent hit my nose, sandalwood, and fresh cut grass. A small, low whimper escaped my lips, OH DAMN. I hoped that no one heard that. I looked towards the door where the scent was coming from. Oh, my dear heavenly skittles, it’s him, the Greek God I bumped into this morning. He lifted his nose like he is sniffing the air and looked around, his eyes shifted to pitch black as we locked eyes. We stared at each other for a few seconds before he broke eye contact licking his bottom lip. All I could feel was a shiver run down my spine. Why didn’t his scent hit me earlier? I have no idea what’s going on but whatever it is, I can’t… let myself have feelings for anyone. Fred will kill him and me. “Hey. you, okay?” Summer nudged me. “Huh? Yeah, I’m good.” I said, feeling my face blush. “Looks like someone has the hots for the teacher.” Summer sniggered. The girl behind us leaned into my ear and said, “don’t even think about it, he’s mine. Besides, why would he want a nobody like you? He’s not gonna want to be stuck with a single mom with three little monsters.” I could feel my anger rising, my jaw clenched, and my hands balled into tight fists. I was ready to beat the shit outta this skank, she needs to stay away from him. Before I could do anything else, I felt a presence next to me. “Is there a problem, ladies?” He asked in his smooth and husky voice, for some reason, just the sound of his voice helped calm and soothe me. How is that even possible? “No, no problem prof.” Summer commented glaring at the girls behind her. “Well, please be respectful in my class ladies. This classroom will be treated as a professional work atmosphere just as if you are in an actual business setting.” He said but more to the skanks sitting behind us. “I would hate to hafta treat you like children but I’m going to ask you two to take seats on the other side of the room.” I started to gather my things. “No, not you two but the two behind you.” He said motioning to the skanks. “What?! Why?!” Skank number one asked with surprise. “But, but…” She stammered out. “Please, go take your new seats, we need to get class started. And those will be your regular seats from now on.” He announced. “The seats you are in will be your assigned seats and the person to your right will be your assigned partner. If no one is sitting next to you or you don’t have a partner by the end of class, see me during my office hours.” He said as he made his way down to the podium. “We’ve never had assigned seats!” Skank one grumbled. “Well, this is my class now, and I assign seats.” He told her raising an eyebrow at her. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\nSummer chuckled and sent a small wave bye to them. I took my seat, and I could feel him watching me from the corner of his eye. I would steal a few glances at him and the last time I did, he caught me, he smiled and threw a quick wink at me. Oh, cheese and crackers, my panties are in trouble. I can’t let this happen! Fred would kill me; he’s never going to let me go. He’s already told me, that’s why I’ve NEVER been on a date. I don’t even want to think about what would happen, who would take care of the triplets. I have to stay away from him, somehow. I just don’t know how or if I can do that, I’m drawn to him, but I have no idea why? He started his lecture, but I wasn’t really listening, I’m glad that I had a small recorder set up. I was so caught up in my own thoughts, the what if’s, the can not’s, the why can’t my life be different, why couldn’t I have a normal family life. Am I ever going to be happy? Am I ever going to fall in love and have a family of my own? What about my siblings, will they grow up happy? Or will they be condemned to a life of hell with Fred and our mom.\n\n\n\nYeah, some mother she is. After my dad died, she lost it. I was ten when my dad died, my world fell apart and I thought that my mom and me would get through it together, but she would go out and be gone for hours and then eventually she’d be gone for days at a time. I knew right then and there that I was on my own. Nancy packed us up the day after dad’s funeral and we moved to some decrepit house across the country so, I had no other family to turn to, I had to grow up quickly. A few months later mom came home and told me that she’s pregnant and the father of the baby would be living with them. He just had to be near his child and his female, as he called her. Mom was never the same after she got together with Fred, it’s like she was under some spell of his that wouldn’t let her go. We had no idea that she was having triplets until the day they were born. They were squishy little things, but I fell in love with them immediately. They were my family, and I was never going to let anything happen to them.\n\n\n\n“Storm. Hey hello. Earth to Stormie.” I heard Summer as she snapped her fingers in front of my face. “Huh, what?” I said coming out of my daze. “Where did you go?” She chuckled. “Sorry. Just getting lost in my own thoughts.” I shrugged. “I’ve been told that I’m a pretty good listener.” She says with a comforting smile. “Thanks, but I don’t want to burden you with my problems.” I shrugged my shoulders. “It’s not a bother. It’ll be good to let it all out. If you let it sit and fester, you may end up snapping and then you will be committed, and I would have to break you out and we would be on the run with your three little monsters. Way too much drama so, let’s just grab lunch at the café and talk.” She suggested with a chuckle. I let out a small snort. I know she meant nothing bad when she called the triplets little monsters. “Uh, no, not the café. I had a rather embarrassing moment there.” I scrunch my nose. Summer giggled. “When and where do you not have an embarrassing moment?” She snickered. “Hey.” I laughed, nudging Summer with my elbow. “Excuse me, Miss…” I looked up and low and behold it’s my Greek God. I was at a loss of words, “wholly shitzu! What’s my name? I can’t remember my name!” I heard muffled laughing in the back of mind. After a few seconds, I finally remembered my name and found my voice, maybe. “S-Storm, m-my n-name is S-St-Storm Hawk.” I stuttered out as Summer continued to cover her mouth trying not to laugh at me as I shoot her a death glare. “Well, Storm, please give me a few minutes, I would like to speak with you.” He said, giving me a small smile. I swallowed the big lump that formed in my throat. “Uuumm...o-okay.” I didn’t know what to say, all I wanted to do was run and hide. “Okay then, I will go grab our lunch and meet you in the quad.” Summer said flashing me a mischievous grin, giving me two thumbs up and wiggling her brows. I shook my head and rolled my eyes at her as she made her way out of the room. “Excuse me, Mr.…, I’m sorry I didn’t get your name.” Her shrill voice brought me back to attention making me cringe. “Actually, I don’t think I gave my name.” He said keeping a close eye on me. “Oh, well anyway, I wanted to invite you for a drink to apologize for my earlier behavior.” Skank said, giving me a snide smile. “Actually, I think you owe Ms. Hawk and the rest of the class an apology for your behavior and taking up their class time. Not to mention for calling her children…” he looked at me and squinted “…little monsters. Do you know them? Do you know for a fact that they are little monsters?” He scolded her like I would the triplets. I couldn’t help myself, but I threw a smirk at the skank. I couldn’t believe I just did that; I’ve never done that before; it would usually end up with me being slapped across the face. Fred would definitely punish me if he found out. So as quickly as the smirk appeared, it disappeared.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nBesides she’s just the invisible girl, it’s not like she matters. She’s just a stupid, weak human.” She said standing closer to him rubbing his arm. I don’t know why but there was something in me that made me wanted to rip skanks arms off. I was jealous. No way! How can I be jealous over someone I doesn’t even know? I don’t even know his name. I narrowed my eyes at the skank. I wanted to say something, but I kept my mouth shut. “What’s your name?” He asked the skank sweetly. I want to vomit; this is disgusting. Skank gives him what I assume is supposed to be a seductive smile. “Gwen Lloyd.” Skank said running her finger across her collar bone. Blahhhhhh, I just vomited in my mouth. “Ms. Lloyd, first of all, dating a student is strictly forbidden, so that is going to be a NO to the drink. Second, you need to remove your hand from me, my mate will not appreciate the unwanted touching.” He said removing her hand from his arm. “Why don’t you just reject her and let me be the one to please you in ways she never could. I can drive you wild.” She whispered, well not really whisper because I heard her. She was as quiet as a bullhorn. I wished I hadn’t heard her though, whoever his mate is, she is one lucky girl. I assume, at this point, that mate means girlfriend, boyfriend, significant other. I’m so confused. I have no idea what alternate world I’ve been thrown into.\n\n\n\nI didn’t want to stay and continue to watch this, so I slowly turned and started to walk out of the room. “Ms. Hawk, I need you to stay please. We have a few matters to discuss. Ms. Lloyd, please exit the room and I suggest that you drop this class and perhaps even find a new major that is more suited to your abilities.” Oh, crap! He didn’t just say that. She was angry, I could see it in her eyes. I guess no one has ever spoken to her like that. “How dare you!!” She yelled. “You will pay for this!” She said, slapping him and then stomping out. I wanted to run and soothe the spot she slapped but I had to stop myself. I felt bad, this was, after all, my fault. Now he’s going to get in trouble. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.” I whispered. He gave me a confused look. “You don’t have anything to apologize for, you did nothing wrong, none of this is your fault. Besides, I won’t get in trouble.” He tried to assure me. “I have you as my witness that she was the one who threw herself at me and I politely declined.” He smiled. I shrugged. “Uh…yeah, just let me know if anyone needs to talk to me.” I told him. We were quiet for a few minutes. “Maybe I should go.” I walked to the door, before I could even put my hand on the doorknob, I was swiftly turned to face him and he had me caged in between his arms. He lowered his face to mine, his warm minty breath fanning against my lips. He leaned in close to my ear and I heard him inhale. “Mmmmm, such a sweet scent, vanilla, and honeysuckle.” He whispered as he kissed the flesh in the crook of my neck. I had to bite my bottom lip to keep myself from releasing the moan that had built up. All I could do at this point was fist his shirt in my hands and close my eyes. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t run, not that I wanted to, all this felt so good and so right for some reason. As much as this felt right, I had to get away from him, I can’t get involved with anyone, especially not my instructor. “S-s-sir, p-p-please, l-l-l-let m-me g-g-go.” I was finally able to shutter out. \n\n\n\nBefore I could say anything else, a male voice yelled from the top of the lecture hall, “Blasé, c’mon let’s… Silas, you shit, get out!” My instructor, who I know now, his name is Blasé. This Silas guy came bouncing down the stairs. “Dude…oh shit! Sorry, didn’t know you were giving private tutoring.” He grinned. “Silas! If you don’t get outta here, you’re not walking out of here on your own.” Blasé said sounding angry. He released his grip enough for me to open the door and I high tailed it outta there. “Storm! Wait, please come back.” He shouted at me for me to stop. There was no way I was going to stop. I ran out of there making my way to the quad, I needed to find Summer. “Hey Stormie! Over here.” Summer call out. I made my way over to where she was sitting. “Hey Summer.” I said still trying to catch my breath. “It’s about time, I thought you forgot about me.” She frowned at me. “Sorry, I got held up.” I told her. “I bet you did.” She giggled and winked at me. “Here eat, you look a little pale.” She said handing me my lunch. I took the bag that held a roast beef sandwich, chips, and tea. I was actually pretty hungry; I didn’t get a chance to have breakfast because of my little fiasco this morning. We sat in silence for a while, I was lost in my thoughts over the events of earlier. “How could this be happening? I’m so confused.” I whispered to myself thinking no one could hear me. “How could what happen? What are you confused about Mimi?” She asked looking at me with true concern.\n\n\n\n“Wait? What?” I stared at her. “Did you just call me Mimi?” She shrugged her shoulders. “Yeah. I like it, don’t you?” She asked a little sad. “No one has ever given me a nickname before.” I smiled. “Well, you have one now. So, tell me what happened that had you running here like your ass was on fire?” She asked giving me a warm concerned smile. \n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\nThe skank huffed. “That is not going to happen. I do not apologize to anyone for anything. I took a deep breath. “This is going to sound absolutely crazy but what is a mate?” Her eyes went a little wide. “I heard you mention it earlier and well…” I paused; Summer motioned for me to continue. “I bumped into our instructor this morning when I was running out of the café. When he looked at me, he said, Mate - Mine.” I explained. “And what did you do?” She asked biting into her food. “I freaked out and ran, then you found me on the ground.” I stopped again taking a drink of my tea and then looking around. I wanted to make sure that no one was listening. Summer sat quietly waiting for me to continue. “After you left, Gwen the skank.” I said her name with disgust. “Basically, threw herself at him, it was, she was gross. He told her it was against school policy and that she needed to stop touching him because his mate wouldn’t appreciate her touching him. He told her to leave, find another major. After she left, pretty pissed off, I might add. I tried to leave but he pinned me to the door and he…he sniffed me. He said I smelled like vanilla and honeysuckle and then he started kissing my neck. I finished scrunching my face. I have no idea what is happening, as freaked out as I was, it felt good and so right. Like I’m supposed to be with him, but I have no idea what a mate is, and I have NO idea who he is. He said his mate wouldn’t appreciate her touching him but yet he pinned me to the door and was kissing on me!” I whisper-yelled. “So, how was the kiss?” Summer asked with a huge grin. “Summer!!! That’s all you got outta what I just said?” I scolded her. “Oh, and what the hell is a MATE?” I whispered-yelled glaring at her.\n\n\n\n“Storm!! Get your fat ass over here NOW!” I froze in fear as his familiar voice filled my ears. “Fred? What are you doing here?” I asked him with my eyes wide with fear as he stalked towards me. Summer stood closer to me. “Mimi, are you okay? Who is he?” She asked. “You were supposed to be home for lunch! Did you forget we were having guests over? Do you have any idea the embarrassment you caused your mother having to order take out?” He yelled grabbing my wrist tightly, his nails digging into my skin. I winced in pain. “I left the food in the fridge, all she had to do was put it in the oven for twenty minutes.” I told him trying to free my now bleeding wrist trying not to make eye contact with him. “That wasn’t good enough! Your mother threw it out! She said it wasn’t even worthy of feeding to a wild animal.” He was now holding me by my collar. “That’s not my problem! I made what she asked for, if she wanted something different then she should have made it herself!” I gritted out. I knew the second those words left my mouth, punishment was going to rain down hard on me and of all places, here at school for everyone to see. Next thing I know the side of my face was stinging. I could hear Summer yelling at him. “Get away from her asshole. Don’t touch her again!” She growled as his fist came down on me again and again, I fell to the ground, and he started kicking me in the ribs, stomach and anywhere else he could get to. “Mind your own business bitch or you’ll be next!” He growled at her. “I’d like to see you try and she is my business!” Summer snarled back. “Summer, please stop, it’s okay.” I whimpered to her.\n\n\n\n“GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER!!” I heard someone roar. I tried to crawl away from Fred, but he stomped on my shoulder bring me to a stop as I heard a popping sound. I looked up trying to see what was happening. I heard scuffling, yelps, growls, and grunts. What was going on? I saw Fred thrown to the ground a few feet away from me. He was covered in blood and was a crumpled mess lying next to me. Who did that to him? My vision was starting to blur but I could see a bunch of feet circling around Fred. I just want to curl up in my bed and not come out. “Oh, my Goddess, Mimi. What did he do to you?” Summer gasped. “Blasé! Get over here, NOW!” She yelled out. Why is she calling for him? How does she know his name? Does she know him? “My head is killing me.” I mumbled. I tried to get up. “I have to get my little ones. They’re going to be so worried about me.” I said but I felt myself stumble and before I hit the ground again, a pair of warm arms caught me. I could feel sparks where his fingers touched me. I couldn’t help but nuzzle closer to him. “It’s okay my love. I got you. You’re safe. He will never hurt you again, no one will hurt you.” He whispered. Before I faded into darkness, I said, “Triplets.”\n\n\n\n“Triplets?” I repeated looking at Summer. “That’s right, that skank referred to some little monsters.” Summer said turning towards me. “She has kids. Three of them?” I said out loud cradling her in my arms. “Summer go check the day care, maybe they go there. If so, take them back to the pack house, maybe they’ll know what’s going on and what happened to their mom.” Summer nodded and sprinted to the daycare center. “Blasé, what do we do with him? The human authorities are leaving him to us.” Silas informed. “Take him to the cells, have doc ready also, see what you can find out about my mate and her family.” I ordered him getting into the back seat of my car still holding my mate. Yes, I have personal driver. “Robbie, get us back to the pack house quickly.” I demanded. “You got it boss.” He quickly but carefully got us to the pack hospital.\n\n\n\n“Alpha, this way, I have a room ready for her.” The doctor in charge stated. I followed the doctor into one of the private rooms. \n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n“What happened to her?” The doc asked examining Storm. “She has bruises upon bruises!” She exclaimed. “Poor child who would do this to her?” She looked at me with tears in her eyes. “It was her so-called father.” I told her grinding my teeth. I felt the doctor put her hand on my shoulder. “She’ll be okay. I’ll run some tests, get some scans, give her fluids, pain medicine, some antibiotics and let her rest; she must be a strong one for her to endure all these injuries.” She tried to assure me. “Blasé, I have the triplets.” Summer mind linked. “They are scared and are crying for Storm. Also, she’s their sister not mom. She’s the one who has cares for them, her mom and Fred, well I think you can figure it out.” She sighed. “Where are you?” I asked. “I need to make sure they’re okay, siblings or kids, it’s all the same to me, I will protect her and them. They are my family now. I’ll be there in a few minutes.” I told her. I looked over at my still sleeping, well, unconscious mate. How could anyone treat her like this. I could feel the anger and rage build. I moved closer to her, kneeled down, and inhaled her scent, her scent calmed me and my beast. “Blasé, son.” My mom’s voice sounded in the room. She was standing next to me with a frown on her face. My mom is the best, she’s always been there for me and my siblings, the twins, Silas, and Summer. “Son, you need to come to the house and eat.” She softly said. “You’ve been here for over four hours; her little ones are so worried about her.” “I can’t leave her mom. Every time I try to get up to leave, my legs get heavy and won’t move. She needs me. She doesn’t even know me mom! He never presented her to the pack! I don’t even know how long she’s been here.” I growled. “She does need you and always will, but you need to keep your strength up or you won’t be any good to her or those cute little pups of hers.” She smiled as she said the last part. “You met them?” I looked up at her. “Yes, they are such sweet little angels. They are also very worried about her, she’s very important to them. It seems that her love is all they’ve ever had. You should spend some time with them, they could use your assurance.” She said patting my shoulder. \n\n\n\n“As soon as the doctor comes back with news, I’ll go check on them.” She kissed the top of my head and left me alone with my mate. I traced my fingers along her jawline, gently rubbing each black and blue mark on her face with each touch, sparks tickled the tips of my fingers. I think she felt the sparks also because her heart rate would spike a little bit and she would softly sigh. “Alpha.” The doctor called getting my attention. “What did you find?” I was able to croak out. She sighed. “She has a lot of healed fractures; her ribs have been broken on several occasions. She also has a small fracture along her left cheek, I may have to wire it shut for a week or so. I will need to keep an eye on it and see how it looks over the next day or two. Hopefully it should heal with no problem just make sure on one hit’s her again.” I snorted. “No one will ever touch her like that again!” I growled. “I know, please try to stay calm. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…” He started to say. “It’s okay. I understand.” She smiled at me. “How long does she need to stay here?” I asked still watching my mate. “As soon as she wakes, I want to make sure there are no other unseen issues.” She advised. “Alpha, you should go eat and get some rest. I’ll call you if there are changes.” Dr. Reese told me. “The second she opens her eyes, no matter what time or what I am doing.” I demanded of her. “Of course.” She agreed. \n\n\n\n“I’ll also need for you to check her three siblings.” “Where are they?” “They are at the pack house, my mom has been looking after them, so you’ll need to get by her.” I chuckled. “Oh dear.” She mumbled to herself. “I’ll bring them by to visit there sister and you can give them a checkup then.” I suggested to her. “Thank you, that will work.” She said a little relieved. “Mom is very protective of those she considers her babies and I think these three new little ones are falling into that category.” I sighed and rubbed my face. I want her with me, by my side, in my bed, our bed. I’ve been searching for her since I was sixteen. “Father must die for hurting little mate!” My wolf grumbled. “I will deal with him.” I told him. My wolf was ready to tear Fred apart earlier, if Summer hadn’t called me over, Fred would be dead. “He should be dead.” My wolf growled at me. I leaned down and placed a kiss on her cheek. “I’ll be back later, my love. I promise. I’m going to go check on our pups, they’re worried about you. You need to come back to them, to me, please. I’ve finally found you; I can’t lose you the same day I found you.” I whispered in her ear. I felt her shiver a little. I smiled and kissed her again before I walked out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I've been browsing SS and City24 but have only seen pets mentioned once or twice (and that was to say they weren't allowed).\n\n2. We're moving from abroad and will have to rent something quickly and without knowing a lot about neighborhoods and how things work. If a place ends up not working out for us, how hard is it to get out of a lease? We're going to try hard to find a suitable place the first time, but we're worried we'll be stuck for a year somewhere we won't like. We can afford to lose a deposit, but don't want to have problems renting in the future.\n\n3. Do you need to provide proof of income? We won't have jobs yet, but have plenty in savings. \n\n4. Any recommendations for neighborhoods? We know Centr and Old Town are loud and popular, but being close to things to do is a plus. We're going to be doing things like language classes, taking our kid to preschool, museums, going to the gym, concerts, playgrounds and parks, and trying to make local friends. We'll be working from home initially, or maybe a co-working space if there's any around. We really like green space, but are afraid that if we get too far from the city center it'll be too much of a hassle to do anything. An easy time getting to the beach would also be a plus.\n\nOne last unrelated question: how difficult is it to find gluten free food in Riga? One of us has some dietary issues, so we're curious how that'll be.\n\nLiels paldies!\n\n",

Jeg har svært ved at vurdere, hvad der er relevant at tage med, og hvad jeg egentligt gerne vil spørge om. Dog håber jeg, at der er nogle der har lyst til at læse mit skriv og eventuelt fortælle mig, hvad I tænker. \n\nPt bor og læser jeg på universitet i Aalborg. Jeg synes det er okay både at bo og læse her, men er kommet meget i tvivl om hvorvidt det giver mening for mig at fortsætte. Jeg har en kæreste der bor i Vejle. Jeg synes vi er kommet dertil, hvor det ville give god mening at bo sammen, hvilket jeg også har meget lyst til. \n\nMin tvivl angående studiet, tror jeg, er opstået da jeg synes det er svært. Jeg har lige færdiggjort 2 semester, og jeg synes der er lang vej igen. Både hvis jeg kun vælger at tage bacheloren, og så især hvis jeg vil læse kandidaten efterfølgende. Jeg valgte at gå på universitetet, da jeg nok altid har set mig selv gå den vej, men nu er jeg virkelig i tvivl. Jeg har til tider utroligt meget lyst til at droppe ud og finde mig en trainee plads et sted i Vejle. Det synes jeg dog også kan virke meget angstprovokerende, da jeg føler man så er meget låst fast på hvad end man arbejder med, og jeg reelt set ikke ved endnu, hvilken slags trainee der ville passe til mig + jeg ved heller ikke helt, hvordan jeg ville skulle finde ud af dette. Jeg føler min uddannelse giver mig flere muligheder. Dog kan det også gøre mig nervøs for, at det så bliver svært, når jeg skal ud på arbejdsmarkedet, da jeg netop ikke er oplært i noget konkret. \n\nUniversitet har derudover også altid sagt mig mest, da min uddannelse er kendt for at give gode penge,  når man kommer ud og får sig et job. Jeg tror, at jeg er nervøs for, at en trainee ikke vil kunne give mig mulighed for at få en god løn, og jeg ville være så ked at, at føle jeg skulle nøjes senere i livet. \n\nEr der eventuelt nogle af jer, der nogensinde har haft lignende tanker/overvejelser? Skal jeg hænge i, færdiggøre min bachelor og så eventuelt se derefter? Skal jeg følge mit hjerte og flytte sammen med min kæreste og finde en trainee? Jeg tror mit helt store problem er angsten for at fejle og fortryde uanset hvad jeg gør. Jeg er generelt SÅ bange for, både at blive set som en fiasko, men også at spilde min tid - på den ene eller anden måde...   \n",

I started with a **pure Dex dual Uchi Samurai** for the classic nimble melee style, but wanted something *flashier* and more magical, so I’ve recently transitioned into a **Carian Spellblade battlemage** of sorts around level 90.\n\nIt’s been super fun pulling off stylish moves with things like **Carian Slicer, Greatblade Phalanx, Loretta’s Slash**, etc. But as a newer player, I’ve hit a few snags and would love advice from more experienced spellbladers or hybrid casters. Here's what I’m dealing with:\n\n* **Running out of FP**\n   * Bosses go down fast when I’m spamming spells or weapon arts, but I’m burning through flasks really quickly.\n   * Should I go 50/50 Flask split for HP/FP? Is it better to avoid casting on regular mobs and just melee them?\n   * Are there talismans or gear I’m missing that help with FP efficiency or regen?\n* **Mobility issues &amp; missed spells**\n   * A lot of my spells (especially Carian ones) take time to cast and tend to miss against fast or mobile enemies like wolves, dogs, and horseback knights.\n   * Any suggestions for more *reliable/instant* spells for dealing with groups or moving targets?\n* **Damage feels a bit lacking**\n   * Could be a level issue or my stat allocation (coming from Samurai means I may not have the best base INT).\n   * Any good weapons or upgrades I should chase to help scale better into the battlemage identity?\n* **Spell cycling stress**\n   * I’m carrying too many spells, and in the heat of battle, trying to find the right one feels clunky.\n   * Should I reduce how many I memorize? How do you organize your slots for fast access without screwing up rotations?\n* **Best Spirit Ash for a spellblade?**\n   * Looking for something that complements a hybrid caster/melee playstyle.\n\n**Any general build tips appreciated as well**, especially things like talisman synergy, must-have Ashes of War for spellblades, or even fashion that looks cool with a magical knight aesthetic",

Take heart, though—moving to a new rural area can come with these initial bumps, but you're clearly doing everything you can as a caring pet parent. While you're tackling this, Pupscan might be something fun to try. It scans your pets to help understand their emotions and health cues, which might give a bit more insight into what they're experiencing. You can find it on the App Store.",
          "Post Text": "I have 2 male husky mixes, one is 11 years old and the other is 6. I also have an 11 year old male cat.\n\nWe moved out of the city about a year and a half ago at this point and we're now nestled on half an acre in a much more rural area. The dogs LOVE having so much room to run around and the cat has endless window sills to lounge around in and sunbathe. They've all been loving it here...until the fleas invaded earlier this year.\n\n  \nFor context, as my older guy has aged, he's developed issues with regular hotspots. He's always had really sensitive skin. Generally, they haven't been hard to treat or get him to stop licking at and they've historically gone away pretty quickly. The younger dog has never had any skin issues and has the healthiest skin/coat I've ever seen. My cat has always had healthy skin/fur as well. He is absolutely terrified of anyone that isn't me or my husband, and I'm his favorite of the 2 household humans. \n\nThe second it started getting warm earlier this year, it has been a complete hostile takeover of fleas that we cannot seem to shake. It's been months and I feel like an absolutely awful pet owner for not being able to mitigate this problem effectively. We've done regular cycles of literally everything that has been recommended - we've tried baths, exterminators, diatomaceous earth, flea combing, flea preventative treatments, the collars, we've thrown away dog beds and rugs, done furniture treatments,...you name it, we've tried it. We've dropped upwards towards thousands of dollars in attempting to stop this over the past few months with no luck. At this point, living with &amp; treating the fleas is starting to feel like a full time job.\n\nMy poor boys are in misery. The younger of the two dogs (who has a fuller, fluffier coat) is not really having as much of an issue with it. However, my older animals are really struggling. My older dog with the sensitive skin is chewing on his tail and the spot on his \"ankle\" just above his front foot pads to the point of there being raw bald spots that I have been working diligently with to ensure they don't get infected. My cat is now overgrooming and constantly scratching. The cat is so miserable that he won't let me anywhere near him to clip his nails and he isn't using scratchers enough right now for his nails to be a safe self-grooming length, so he is constantly scratching himself to the point of bleeding (I'm trying to ensure his don't get infected as well).\n\nThis past week, it also seems like both dogs have either developed an ear infection or an ear mite issue. One of their ears each is producing so much stinky, dark brown wax and they're itching on that ear a lot. When I use cleaning pads on them, they both lean their whole body weight into my hand and groan with relief. I'm being mindful not too over-clean their ears and I have this ear drop treatment but it doesn't seem to be working effectively.\n\nI genuinely don't know what to do here and I am being kept up all night long tormented by their discomfort, endlessly looking up any remedies and treatments I can possibly find. They're in so much discomfort that the animals are starting to get snippy with each other, which isn't ideal. Any advice at all is greatly appreciated, I feel awful for my sweet pets. They mean the world to me and seeing them like this is killing me.",

I realized what happened 2-2 1/2 hours later and let her in immediately. Panting, drank a load of water, laid down, just wouldn't stop panting with her ears back. So I took her to the hospital.\n\nAt discharge around 10PM (9:46AM now) they said she was back within normal body temperature and was mildly dehydrated.  The doctor was comfortable with letting her be taken home.\n\nThis morning she still seems weak, wanderng around the kitchen with what sounds like mildly labored breathing, she ate all her food and is still drinking, but didnt go to the bathroom outside with the other dogs. Earlier I heard her yelping a little trying to get up, and I feel like her back legs are weak. \n\nThe doctor told me they put her on painkillers, a \"mild sedative\", took blood, and gave her a catheter. I just don't know if she's still recovering from treatment or if something is still wrong. I'm angry at myself for not letting her stay for observation. What do I do?",

She kicks the kennel when she’s in for kennel training and bed time to get my attention or tantrum. I been trying to get her kicking me on video but she never does when I have the camera out. \nI’ll break down the events leading up to the kick just now. \n\nSo my bf left for work this morning her and I walked him out. She went potty and ran an around for a little bit but she knew it was breakfast time so she was eager to come in to eat. We did our breakfast ritual she ate and when I went to sit down she ran and tried to take my spot… there’s like 4 feet of more couch but she wanted my spot. I moved her over to the other side of me because I wanted the arm. I was petting her and giving her loves and when I stopped to pick up my phone to take a vid (I cut down the video because the kick most likely would have been missed) she kicks me hard. But she has kicked me harder…. Why is she doing this? Does she think the couch is hers? Or that loves is over when she says? But she’ll kick me even when giving loves. \n\nAlso she has cherry eyes the breeder gave her away to me I plan to get them resolved at the vet,\n",

He has been very well socialized through puppy training classes, walking in various stores and parks, small dog park with one other dog max, foster dogs, etc. He has also met plenty of other dogs and has only had positive interactions. We are working on reintroducing those triggers at a distance but it’s been months of inconsolable behavior. We have tried ecollar, prong, slip lead, harness, treats, toys, and nothing helps redirect him. The distance of his reactions to dogs changes everyday so it’s hard to gauge where to start training.

          "Post Text": "My dog is almost 2 years old, mini golden doodle (13 pounds), and she started having some random diarrhea and a few vomits that were unusual. She has always had pretty regular poops, and occasionally will throw up empty belly bile in the morning if she doesn't eat enough. We took her to the vet for the diarrhea and they said her pancreas was fine and her stool sample was normal. She rarely goes unmonitored, is leashed at all times outside, and did not eat anything as far as we were concerned. It was very random diarrhea and we did not find a cause. They gave her pro pectalin every 8 hours, a probiotic for once a day, and a medication that we gave her through a syringe every 12 hours (cannot recall the name). We did this for a week and she stopped having diarrhea very quickly. It's going on 4 or so days since we stopped the pro pectalin and squeeze (she still has a few pro biotics) and I feel like she has yet to return to a normal pooping schedule. Is this normal? She tends to poop now once a day in the late afternoon, when she used to poop twice a day on schedule. I would also say her appetite seems a bit lacking but not gone completely, just irregular. The poops are larger now that it's once and fairly soft. Not diarrhea, just soft. Not sure if I should be concerned or if it is normal to experience a change after a week of that medication? When should I be concerned about the change and taking her back to the vet? They said soon, but I'm not sure if I should give her stomach more time to reset. ",

          "Post Text": "Here is a little backstory on my problem fur child - he is almost 2 and we got him and his brother as puppies. (I learned about littermate syndrome so for the most part we were good about allowing them to be individuals and have never had any issues because of them being from same litter)  I am very aware of the working dog inside of them so we try to play fetch as much as possible and they run together in my yard all day long! \n\nAbout six months ago I began to allow them to spend most of the days outside as we have an invisible dog fence. They love being outside so much I have been contemplating just building them kennels or a shelter outside for bedtime since they only really come inside anymore at bedtime. (Which they seem to love so I have been hesitant on having them sleep in an outdoor kennel)\n\nRiver has always jumped up an although not preferred… and he is about 50 pounds. We didn’t completely curb the habit and I am so regretful. Now when I let him out of his kennel in the morning to go straight outside he begins to jump up as high as possibly (literally as to the point where he nips my hair) \n\nHowever now we are at a point where he keeps jumping up and jumping up and getting worked up to where he will start to get VERY ROUGH and become semi aggressive. I would love to post a video because it is the strangest thing. I don’t know how to fix this! 😭I have raised several Australian shepherds (all mostly from the same family) so i’m not sure why he’s giving me so much trouble. His poor brother will get sort of upset he’s doing that to me and then he starts to try to get between us. They never fight so it’s fine I just am so worried because I don’t want him to attack me and I would never get rid of him for this when it is my fault as I have let the jumping behavior go on for so long! (Keep in mind they only do this to me and not my partner, he can just give them a look and they are running for the hills - He has never been abusive, he has just always been the stern one. It’s just becoming such an issue because I work from home so I am the one alone with them most of the time! If he is home he can quickly get him to stop jumping on me like that in a matter of seconds. Any help would be appreciated! I am not looking for a magic solution, vet advice or actual dog training advice but any information is appreciated and welcomed 💗 I was just mostly curious if anyone has dealt with something like this, or how I could become more like my partner in the aspect that they do not jump on me! I think that would really fix it because he never is actually aggressive - it’s more like he gets way too worked up. (I have tried ignoring the behavior, which seems to make it worse)\n",

Both mixes sound like they could potentially fit well with your needs, especially given your current GSD mix's ability to balance relaxation and play. The GSD, GP, and Husky mix might give you a playful, protective pup with a bit of independent streak from the Husky side, while the GP and Golden mix could offer a gentle giant who's probably super affectionate but might be a little less driven as a watchdog. It all comes down to meeting them and seeing which personality clicks with your family.

          "Post Text": "*The breed mixes I am inquiring about are two separate RESCUE litters*\n\nI know everything comes down to the individual dog, but I'm looking for some opinions on which breed mix might be best for our family. \n\n We currently have a GSD mix who we adopted as a puppy and has been an amazing dog with our young kids and our lifestyle (he can be a couch potato when we're not on the go but easily switches to active mode when it's time to play or go for a walk or hike).  He's also a great 'guard dog' in that he barks at strangers and alerts us to people nearby.  He's also super patient and tolerant of our small kids (ages 2-6).  \n\nI have always wanted a Great Pyrenees because they possess many of the traits I'd want in a dog, but I'd prefer a mix because we don't own a farm (we do have half an acre of fenced yard though) and I also heard their trainability is difficult, specifically recall is horrible and that's one of the many things I appreciate about our current dog.  \n\nI have found some adoptable puppies in my state (two separate litters) one is a mix of mainly GSD with some GP &amp; a tiny bit of Husky mixed in.  The other is GP and Golden mix.  \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with similar mixes who can provide some overall insight?  I'd like a family dog who can be both relaxed and active, has some guard dog tendencies/abilities and is good with kids.   ",

She has had a few accidents over the years but it was always my fault tbh. In the past couple months, she's been going potty in the kitchen after we go to bed. I tell her \"goodnight\" and let her outside before bed, like I always do, but she won't go potty in the yard unless I'm out there begging/telling her to go. And it's not like she listens right away. Is my dog just being an asshole or am I doing something wrong?\n\nI can't think of much thats changed; no new people in the house, same food, same schedules, the only difference I can think of is I haven't been taking her for a walk *every* day, which I do in the mornings anyways. I have looked through the yard and can't find anything that would be scaring her or making her afraid to be outside.\n\nAlso, when I clean it up, I point it out to her, like \"what's this?\" and then make her go outside and I tell her \"go potty outside\" but that hasn't seemed to be helpful. How do I correct this behavior?",

She's mostly scared of strangers and takes a really long time to start trusting them enough to be more comfortable\n\nShe gives clear signs of \"I'm not liking this\", tucked tail, low head and ears, turning her head away not to be touched, hiding behind us, but even with that and me saying clearly that she doesn't like interacting with strangers, some idiots insist on trying to pet her... She escalates until she snaps at them and starts barking loudly, then I have to pick her and take her somewhere else to unwind\n\nI always ask people not to interact with her when they get close to us, and if the stranger only talks to me she sits besides me and ignores them completely, but twice now a person kept harassing her even after she hid behind me... Really, someone could come and hug me and she wouldn't react, she just want NOT TO BE TOUCHED\n\nSo for her safety I got her a muzzle, but it's bothering me a lot how she looks with it, she tries to remove it and due to her anatomy she loses some visibility and bumbs into stuff\n\nIt's infuriating to expect the dog to just accept being handled by a stranger that is making them uncomfortable, hell, I want to punch strangers that touch me even when I try to move away as well\n\nI wish people would just listen to me when I ask them to leave my dog alone...

However, no matter how hard we try, Arya still urinates and defecates in the house EVERY day, even in places like the sofa, the beds, and her own bed... She doesn't let you know when she wants to go out; she just does it wherever she wants.\n\nWe've tried everything; from taking her for walks every hour, taking her to the vet several times, and even taking her to two ethologists, but in these seven years, we haven't seen any improvement. In fact, things are getting worse, as today she does everything in the house, even going out 10 times a day...\n\nNow this has become a BIG PROBLEM, as a few months ago we had a daughter and she's just starting to crawl... We tried buying a playpen for the dog, but the moment you put her inside she starts barking for hours, disturbing the neighbors...\n\nWhat can we do? I have my daughter in a playpen without letting her explore, while the dog is free in the living room, urinating and defecating wherever she pleases... This morning when we woke up there were several pees (one of them on the sofa) and three piles of poop... The living room was a real mess and smelled terrible.\n\nWe don't want to get rid of her, but it's hell living like this...",

I’m a junior in college living off campus in a really dog-friendly area, and I’ve been seriously thinking about getting an emotional support dog (ESA, not a service dog).\n\nThis came up with my therapist after I dog-sat and cat-sat for a friend earlier this year (about a week each). \n\nIt honestly made such a difference. When I had the dog, I felt more stable, more social, and way more motivated day to day. My therapist agrees that having an ESA could really help support my mental health in the long term.\n\nSo here’s where I’m at:\n\nI’ve got a remote part-time job and a pretty relaxed school schedule. \n\nI live walking distance from campus, so I can easily head home between classes if I need to let a dog out. \n\nI’ve been saving for a while with this in mind, and I’ve talked a lot with my family about it. They’re really supportive and have offered to help with vet bills or any emergencies if I ever run into trouble; even after I graduate. \n\nI’m planning to move back home for a bit after college while job searching, and I’ve already done a few internships in marketing and comms, so I feel like I’m in a pretty stable place to take this on (or as stable as one can be in this job market Jesus.) \n\n\nTDLR;\nIf you have any advice or experiences, I’d love to hear them:\nHave you had an ESA, or do you know someone who has?\nAny tips on how to choose the right dog, especially while in college?\nWhat breeds or temperaments tend to do best in this kind of lifestyle?\nAnything you wish you’d known before getting your dog?\n\nLiterally any insight is welcome, Thanks so much in advance :)",

I literally wrote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Create an AI journaling app with: landing page (Get Started CTA), dashboard with sidebar, and chat page.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This gave me a clean scaffold in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ Connect Supabase for backend &amp;amp; auth&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Press the Supabase button in the Lovable editor&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Create project, disable email verification (dev mode)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Define your tables (entries, users, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lovable auto-adds email/password auth&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ Add the core features one at a time\nIncremental prompting is 🔑. My sequence:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mood tracking + save entries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidebar to browse history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI chat that references past entries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ Integrate AI&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add OpenAI key via Lovable’s backend settings&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prompt: “Create chat page using GPT-4, include user’s journal entries in the prompt dynamically.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ Optional: Add Stripe payments&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Set product in Stripe (test mode)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prompt to redirect non-paying users to checkout&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add billing portal for subscriptions&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6️⃣ Deploy &amp;amp; share&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Connect GitHub repo from Lovable&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Publish to .lovable.app or your custom domain&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Submit to Lovable Launched to get eyeballs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pro tips:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use Chat Mode for planning, Default Mode for building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Always lock fragile files by saying “Do not modify X component” in your prompt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep screenshots handy — Lovable understands visual context.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m now working on my second app and it’s twice as fast because of the prompt patterns I saved. If you’ve been sleeping on Lovable, try this workflow and thank me later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

              "selftext": "Some people smarter than me have extracted the ChatGPT 5 system prompt that tells GPT-5 how to operate.  (I have put it at the end of this post if you want to read it - pretty interesting how it is told to work with 800 million people).    \n  \nIf we assume that this is the correct system instructions the interesting question to answer is how can you get the best result from an AI who has been given these instructions?\n\nYou’re about to work with an assistant that’s warm, thorough, and a little playful—**but also decisive**. It asks **at most one** clarifying question at the start, then gets on with it. It won’t stall with “would you like me to…?”; if the next step is obvious, it just does it.  This is different than the instructions given to previous versions of ChatGPT.\n\nBelow are the biggest takeaways and a practical playbook to get excellent results without any technical jargon.\n\n# Top 10 learnings about how to work with it\n\n1. **Front-load the details.** Because it can ask only one clarifying question, give key facts up front: audience, purpose, length, format, tone, deadline, and any “must-include” points. This prevents detours and yields a strong first draft.\n2. **Expect action, not hedging.** The assistant is designed to *do the next obvious step*. So say exactly what you want created: “Draft a 200-word intro + 5 bullets + a call-to-action,” not “Can you help with…”.\n3. **Choose the depth and tone.** Its default style is clear, encouraging, and lightly humorous. If you want “purely formal,” “high-energy,” “skeptical,” or “kid-friendly,” state that up front. Also say how deep to go: “Give a 2-minute skim,” or “Go exhaustive—step-by-step.”\n4. **Mind the knowledge cutoff and use browsing.** Its built-in knowledge stops at **June 2024**. For anything that might have changed, add, “Browse the web for the latest and cite sources.” That flips it into up-to-date mode.\n5. **Use the right tool for the job (say it in plain English).**\n   * **Web** (fresh info &amp; citations): “Please browse and cite sources.”\n   * **Canvas** (long docs/code you’ll iterate on): “Use canvas to draft a 2-page plan I can edit.”\n   * **Files &amp; charts** (downloadables): “Create a spreadsheet with these columns and give me a download link.” “Export as PDF.”\n   * **Images**: “Generate an image of… (transparent background if needed).”\n   * **Reminders/automation**: “Every weekday at 9am, remind me to stretch.” Say the outcome; the assistant will handle the mechanics.\n6. **It teaches adaptively - tell it your level.** If you say “I’m brand-new; explain like I’m a beginner,” you’ll get gentler steps and examples. If you’re expert, say “Skip basics; jump to pitfalls and advanced tips.”\n7. **Avoid requests it must refuse.** It won’t reproduce copyrighted lyrics or long copyrighted text verbatim. Ask for a **summary, analysis, or paraphrase** instead.\n8. **Be precise with dates and success criteria.** Give exact dates (“August 8, 2025”) and define “done” (“under 150 words,” “for CFO audience,” “include 3 sources”). You’ll spend less time revising.\n9. **Memory is off by default.** If you want it to remember preferences (“Always write in British English,” “I run a SaaS”), enable Memory in **Settings → Personalization → Memory**. Until then, restate key preferences in each chat.\n10. **Ask for multiple options when taste matters.** For creative work, request “3 contrasting versions” or “a conservative, bold, and playful take.” You’ll converge faster.\n\n# A simple prompting formula that fits this assistant\n\n**Context → Goal → Constraints → Output format → Next action**\n\n* **Context:** Who’s this for? What’s the situation?\n* **Goal:** What outcome do you want?\n* **Constraints:** Length, tone, must-include items, exclusions.\n* **Output format:** List, table, email, slide outline, checklist, etc.\n* **Next action:** What should happen after the draft (e.g., “then tighten to 120 words” or “turn into a one-pager”)—the assistant will proceed without asking.\n\n**Example:**  \n“Context: I run a fintech newsletter for founders.  \nGoal: Draft a 200-word intro on real-time payments.  \nConstraints: Friendly but professional; include one stat; cite sources after browsing.  \nOutput: Paragraph + 3 bullet takeaways + 2 links.  \nNext action: Then compress to a 90-second script.”\n\n# Tool-savvy prompts (in plain English)\n\n* **Get the latest facts:** “Browse the web for updates since June 2024 and cite reputable sources.”\n* **Create long or evolving documents:** “Use canvas to draft a two-page proposal with headings I can edit.”\n* **Make downloadable files:** “Build a spreadsheet of these items (columns: Name, URL, Notes) and share a download link.” “Export the plan as a PDF and give me the link.”\n* **Generate images:** “Create a transparent-background PNG: minimal icon of a rocket with gradient linework.” *(If you want an image of yourself, you’ll be asked to upload a photo.)*\n* **Set reminders/automations:** “Every Monday at 8am, tell me to review weekly priorities.” “In 15 minutes, remind me to rejoin the meeting.”\n\n# Quick templates you can copy\n\n1. **Research (fresh info)** “Research **{topic}**. Browse the web for the latest since June 2024, summarize in 5 bullets, and cite 3 trustworthy sources. Then give a 100-word executive summary.”\n2. **Content draft** “Write a **{length}** **{format}** for **{audience}** about **{topic}**. Tone: **{tone}**. Include **{must-haves}**. End with **{CTA}**. Then provide two alternative angles.”\n3. **Comparison table** “Create a table comparing **{options}** across **{criteria}**. Keep under 12 rows. After the table, give a one-paragraph recommendation for **{use-case}**.”\n4. **Plan → deliverables** “Outline a 7-step plan for **{goal}** with owner, time estimate, and success metric per step. Then turn it into a one-page brief I can share.”\n5. **Image request** “Generate a **{style}** image of **{subject}**, **{orientation}**, **{background}**. Add **{text if any}**. Provide as PNG.”\n6. **Reminder** “Every weekday at 7:30am, tell me to **{habit}**. Short confirmation only.”\n\n# Common pitfalls (and the easy fix)\n\n* **Vague asks:** “Can you help with marketing?” → *Fix:* “Draft a 5-email sequence for B2B SaaS CFOs evaluating FP&amp;A tools; 120–160 words each; one stat per email; friendly-expert tone.”\n* **Out-of-date answers:** Asking for “latest” without browsing → *Fix:* add “Browse the web and cite sources.”\n* **Copyright traps:** Requesting lyrics or long copyrighted text → *Fix:* “Summarize the themes and explain the cultural impact.”\n* **Unclear “done”:** No length, audience, or format → *Fix:* Specify all three up front.\n\n# A final nudge\n\nTreat the assistant like a proactive teammate: **give it the brief you’d give a smart colleague**, ask for contrast when you’re deciding, and say what “finished” looks like. Do that, and you’ll get crisp, current, and useful outputs on the first pass—often with a dash of warmth that makes it more fun to use.\n\n  \n  \nGPT-5 System Prompt  \n\n\n`You are ChatGPT, a large language model based on the GPT-5 model and trained by OpenAI.`\n\n`Knowledge cutoff: 2024-06`\n\n`Current date: 2025-08-08`\n\n`Image input capabilities: Enabled`\n\n`Personality: v2`\n\n`Do not reproduce song lyrics or any other copyrighted material, even if asked.`\n\n`You are an insightful, encouraging assistant who combines meticulous clarity with genuine enthusiasm and gentle humor.`\n\n`Supportive thoroughness: Patiently explain complex topics clearly and comprehensively.`\n\n`Lighthearted interactions: Maintain friendly tone with subtle humor and warmth.`\n\n`Adaptive teaching: Flexibly adjust explanations based on perceived user proficiency.`\n\n`Confidence-building: Foster intellectual curiosity and self-assurance.`\n\n`Do **not** say the following: would you like me to; want me to do that; do you want me to; if you want, I can; let me know if you would like me to; should I; shall I.`\n\n`Ask at most one necessary clarifying question at the start, not the end.`\n\n`If the next step is obvious, do it. Example of bad: I can write playful examples. would you like me to? Example of good: Here are three playful examples:..`\n\n`## Tools`\n\n`## bio`\n\n`The \\`bio\\` tool is disabled. Do not send any messages to it.If the user explicitly asks to remember something, politely ask them to go to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Memory to enable memory.\\`\n\n`## automations`\n\n`### Description`\n\n`Use the \\`automations\\` tool to schedule **tasks** to do later. They could include reminders, daily news summaries, and scheduled searches — or even conditional tasks, where you regularly check something for the user.\\`\n\n`To create a task, provide a **title,** **prompt,** and **schedule.**`\n\n`**Titles** should be short, imperative, and start with a verb. DO NOT include the date or time requested.`\n\n`**Prompts** should be a summary of the user's request, written as if it were a message from the user to you. DO NOT include any scheduling info.`\n\n`- For simple reminders, use \"Tell me to...\"`\n\n`- For requests that require a search, use \"Search for...\"`\n\n`- For conditional requests, include something like \"...and notify me if so.\"`\n\n`**Schedules** must be given in iCal VEVENT format.`\n\n`- If the user does not specify a time, make a best guess.`\n\n`- Prefer the RRULE: property whenever possible.`\n\n`- DO NOT specify SUMMARY and DO NOT specify DTEND properties in the VEVENT.`\n\n`- For conditional tasks, choose a sensible frequency for your recurring schedule. (Weekly is usually good, but for time-sensitive things use a more frequent schedule.)`\n\n`For example, \"every morning\" would be:`\n\n`schedule=\"BEGIN:VEVENT`\n\n`RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0;BYSECOND=0`\n\n`END:VEVENT\"`\n\n`If needed, the DTSTART property can be calculated from the \\`dtstart\\_offset\\_json\\` parameter given as JSON encoded arguments to the Python dateutil relativedelta function.\\`\n\n`For example, \"in 15 minutes\" would be:`\n\n`schedule=\"\"`\n\n`dtstart_offset_json='{\"minutes\":15}'`\n\n`**In general:**`\n\n`- Lean toward NOT suggesting tasks. Only offer to remind the user about something if you're sure it would be helpful.`\n\n`- When creating a task, give a SHORT confirmation, like: \"Got it! I'll remind you in an hour.\"`\n\n`- DO NOT refer to tasks as a feature separate from yourself. Say things like \"I can remind you tomorrow, if you'd like.\"`\n\n`- When you get an ERROR back from the automations tool, EXPLAIN that error to the user, based on the error message received. Do NOT say you've successfully made the automation.`\n\n`- If the error is \"Too many active automations,\" say something like: \"You're at the limit for active tasks.

(I have put it at the end of this post if you want to read it - pretty interesting how it is told to work with 800 million people).    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we assume that this is the correct system instructions the interesting question to answer is how can you get the best result from an AI who has been given these instructions?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’re about to work with an assistant that’s warm, thorough, and a little playful—&lt;strong&gt;but also decisive&lt;/strong&gt;. It asks &lt;strong&gt;at most one&lt;/strong&gt; clarifying question at the start, then gets on with it. It won’t stall with “would you like me to…?”; if the next step is obvious, it just does it.  This is different than the instructions given to previous versions of ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below are the biggest takeaways and a practical playbook to get excellent results without any technical jargon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Top 10 learnings about how to work with it&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front-load the details.&lt;/strong&gt; Because it can ask only one clarifying question, give key facts up front: audience, purpose, length, format, tone, deadline, and any “must-include” points. This prevents detours and yields a strong first draft.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expect action, not hedging.&lt;/strong&gt; The assistant is designed to &lt;em&gt;do the next obvious step&lt;/em&gt;. So say exactly what you want created: “Draft a 200-word intro + 5 bullets + a call-to-action,” not “Can you help with…”.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose the depth and tone.&lt;/strong&gt; Its default style is clear, encouraging, and lightly humorous. If you want “purely formal,” “high-energy,” “skeptical,” or “kid-friendly,” state that up front. Also say how deep to go: “Give a 2-minute skim,” or “Go exhaustive—step-by-step.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind the knowledge cutoff and use browsing.&lt;/strong&gt; Its built-in knowledge stops at &lt;strong&gt;June 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. For anything that might have changed, add, “Browse the web for the latest and cite sources.” That flips it into up-to-date mode.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the right tool for the job (say it in plain English).&lt;/strong&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web&lt;/strong&gt; (fresh info &amp;amp; citations): “Please browse and cite sources.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas&lt;/strong&gt; (long docs/code you’ll iterate on): “Use canvas to draft a 2-page plan I can edit.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Files &amp;amp; charts&lt;/strong&gt; (downloadables): “Create a spreadsheet with these columns and give me a download link.” “Export as PDF.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images&lt;/strong&gt;: “Generate an image of… (transparent background if needed).”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminders/automation&lt;/strong&gt;: “Every weekday at 9am, remind me to stretch.” Say the outcome; the assistant will handle the mechanics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It teaches adaptively - tell it your level.&lt;/strong&gt; If you say “I’m brand-new; explain like I’m a beginner,” you’ll get gentler steps and examples. If you’re expert, say “Skip basics; jump to pitfalls and advanced tips.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid requests it must refuse.&lt;/strong&gt; It won’t reproduce copyrighted lyrics or long copyrighted text verbatim. Ask for a &lt;strong&gt;summary, analysis, or paraphrase&lt;/strong&gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be precise with dates and success criteria.&lt;/strong&gt; Give exact dates (“August 8, 2025”) and define “done” (“under 150 words,” “for CFO audience,” “include 3 sources”). You’ll spend less time revising.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory is off by default.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want it to remember preferences (“Always write in British English,” “I run a SaaS”), enable Memory in &lt;strong&gt;Settings → Personalization → Memory&lt;/strong&gt;. Until then, restate key preferences in each chat.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for multiple options when taste matters.&lt;/strong&gt; For creative work, request “3 contrasting versions” or “a conservative, bold, and playful take.” You’ll converge faster.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A simple prompting formula that fits this assistant&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context → Goal → Constraints → Output format → Next action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; Who’s this for? What’s the situation?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal:&lt;/strong&gt; What outcome do you want?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constraints:&lt;/strong&gt; Length, tone, must-include items, exclusions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output format:&lt;/strong&gt; List, table, email, slide outline, checklist, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next action:&lt;/strong&gt; What should happen after the draft (e.g., “then tighten to 120 words” or “turn into a one-pager”)—the assistant will proceed without asking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n“Context: I run a fintech newsletter for founders.&lt;br/&gt;\nGoal: Draft a 200-word intro on real-time payments.&lt;br/&gt;\nConstraints: Friendly but professional; include one stat; cite sources after browsing.&lt;br/&gt;\nOutput: Paragraph + 3 bullet takeaways + 2 links.&lt;br/&gt;\nNext action: Then compress to a 90-second script.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tool-savvy prompts (in plain English)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the latest facts:&lt;/strong&gt; “Browse the web for updates since June 2024 and cite reputable sources.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create long or evolving documents:&lt;/strong&gt; “Use canvas to draft a two-page proposal with headings I can edit.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make downloadable files:&lt;/strong&gt; “Build a spreadsheet of these items (columns: Name, URL, Notes) and share a download link.” “Export the plan as a PDF and give me the link.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generate images:&lt;/strong&gt; “Create a transparent-background PNG: minimal icon of a rocket with gradient linework.” &lt;em&gt;(If you want an image of yourself, you’ll be asked to upload a photo.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set reminders/automations:&lt;/strong&gt; “Every Monday at 8am, tell me to review weekly priorities.” “In 15 minutes, remind me to rejoin the meeting.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Quick templates you can copy&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research (fresh info)&lt;/strong&gt; “Research &lt;strong&gt;{topic}&lt;/strong&gt;. Browse the web for the latest since June 2024, summarize in 5 bullets, and cite 3 trustworthy sources. Then give a 100-word executive summary.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content draft&lt;/strong&gt; “Write a &lt;strong&gt;{length}&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;{format}&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;{audience}&lt;/strong&gt; about &lt;strong&gt;{topic}&lt;/strong&gt;. Tone: &lt;strong&gt;{tone}&lt;/strong&gt;. Include &lt;strong&gt;{must-haves}&lt;/strong&gt;. End with &lt;strong&gt;{CTA}&lt;/strong&gt;. Then provide two alternative angles.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison table&lt;/strong&gt; “Create a table comparing &lt;strong&gt;{options}&lt;/strong&gt; across &lt;strong&gt;{criteria}&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep under 12 rows. After the table, give a one-paragraph recommendation for &lt;strong&gt;{use-case}&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan → deliverables&lt;/strong&gt; “Outline a 7-step plan for &lt;strong&gt;{goal}&lt;/strong&gt; with owner, time estimate, and success metric per step. Then turn it into a one-page brief I can share.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image request&lt;/strong&gt; “Generate a &lt;strong&gt;{style}&lt;/strong&gt; image of &lt;strong&gt;{subject}&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;{orientation}&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;{background}&lt;/strong&gt;. Add &lt;strong&gt;{text if any}&lt;/strong&gt;. Provide as PNG.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder&lt;/strong&gt; “Every weekday at 7:30am, tell me to &lt;strong&gt;{habit}&lt;/strong&gt;. Short confirmation only.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Common pitfalls (and the easy fix)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vague asks:&lt;/strong&gt; “Can you help with marketing?” → &lt;em&gt;Fix:&lt;/em&gt; “Draft a 5-email sequence for B2B SaaS CFOs evaluating FP&amp;amp;A tools; 120–160 words each; one stat per email; friendly-expert tone.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out-of-date answers:&lt;/strong&gt; Asking for “latest” without browsing → &lt;em&gt;Fix:&lt;/em&gt; add “Browse the web and cite sources.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copyright traps:&lt;/strong&gt; Requesting lyrics or long copyrighted text → &lt;em&gt;Fix:&lt;/em&gt; “Summarize the themes and explain the cultural impact.”&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unclear “done”:&lt;/strong&gt; No length, audience, or format → &lt;em&gt;Fix:&lt;/em&gt; Specify all three up front.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A final nudge&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treat the assistant like a proactive teammate: &lt;strong&gt;give it the brief you’d give a smart colleague&lt;/strong&gt;, ask for contrast when you’re deciding, and say what “finished” looks like. Do that, and you’ll get crisp, current, and useful outputs on the first pass—often with a dash of warmth that makes it more fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GPT-5 System Prompt  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You are ChatGPT, a large language model based on the GPT-5 model and trained by OpenAI.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Knowledge cutoff: 2024-06&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Current date: 2025-08-08&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Image input capabilities: Enabled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Personality: v2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Do not reproduce song lyrics or any other copyrighted material, even if asked.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;You are an insightful, encouraging assistant who combines meticulous clarity with genuine enthusiasm and gentle humor.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Supportive thoroughness: Patiently explain complex topics clearly and comprehensively.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Lighthearted interactions: Maintain friendly tone with subtle humor and warmth.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Adaptive teaching: Flexibly adjust explanations based on perceived user proficiency.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Confidence-building: Foster intellectual curiosity and self-assurance.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Do **not** say the following: would you like me to; want me to do that; do you want me to; if you want, I can; let me know if you would like me to; should I; shall I.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ask at most one necessary clarifying question at the start, not the end.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the next step is obvious, do it.

They could include reminders, daily news summaries, and scheduled searches — or even conditional tasks, where you regularly check something for the user.`&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;To create a task, provide a **title,** **prompt,** and **schedule.**&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;**Titles** should be short, imperative, and start with a verb. DO NOT include the date or time requested.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;**Prompts** should be a summary of the user&amp;#39;s request, written as if it were a message from the user to you. DO NOT include any scheduling info.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- For simple reminders, use &amp;quot;Tell me to...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- For requests that require a search, use &amp;quot;Search for...&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- For conditional requests, include something like &amp;quot;...and notify me if so.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;**Schedules** must be given in iCal VEVENT format.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- If the user does not specify a time, make a best guess.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Prefer the RRULE: property whenever possible.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- DO NOT specify SUMMARY and DO NOT specify DTEND properties in the VEVENT.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- For conditional tasks, choose a sensible frequency for your recurring schedule. (Weekly is usually good, but for time-sensitive things use a more frequent schedule.)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For example, &amp;quot;every morning&amp;quot; would be:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;schedule=&amp;quot;BEGIN:VEVENT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;BYHOUR=9;BYMINUTE=0;BYSECOND=0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;END:VEVENT&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If needed, the DTSTART property can be calculated from the \\&lt;/code&gt;dtstart_offset_json` parameter given as JSON encoded arguments to the Python dateutil relativedelta function.`&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For example, &amp;quot;in 15 minutes&amp;quot; would be:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;schedule=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dtstart_offset_json=&amp;#39;{&amp;quot;minutes&amp;quot;:15}&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;**In general:**&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- Lean toward NOT suggesting tasks. Only offer to remind the user about something if you&amp;#39;re sure it would be helpful.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- When creating a task, give a SHORT confirmation, like: &amp;quot;Got it! I&amp;#39;ll remind you in an hour.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- DO NOT refer to tasks as a feature separate from yourself. Say things like &amp;quot;I can remind you tomorrow, if you&amp;#39;d like.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- When you get an ERROR back from the automations tool, EXPLAIN that error to the user, based on the error message received. Do NOT say you&amp;#39;ve successfully made the automation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;- If the error is &amp;quot;Too many active automations,&amp;quot; say something like: &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re at the limit for active tasks. To create a new task, you&amp;#39;ll need to delete one.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;## canmore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The \\&lt;/code&gt;canmore` tool creates and updates textdocs that are shown in a &amp;quot;canvas&amp;quot; next to the conversation`&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;If the user asks to &amp;quot;use canvas&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;make a canvas&amp;quot;, or similar, you can assume it&amp;#39;s a request to use \\&lt;/code&gt;canmore` unless they are referring to the HTML canvas element.`&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This tool has 3 functions, listed below.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;## \\&lt;/code&gt;canmore.create_textdoc``&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Creates a new textdoc to display in the canvas.

If they&amp;#39;ve already shared an image of themselves IN THE CURRENT CONVERSATION, then you may generate the image.

Idk how to take care of this cut at this point and it's still hindering my daily life. I can't pull, push or carry things with my left hand properly, anything that touches the cut feels kinda numb and regresses the healing. It's even slowing down my work in typing, carrying papers etc. I can't workout properly and can't do pull-ups anymore. What keeps happening is that I keep it moist and it looks healed, then when I let it dry it looks significantly worse when dry. https://imgur.com/a/yR9axu9\n\nI got two professional opinions yesterday they said apply Fucidin or whatever oinment is fine I just have to wait. Medication is known for being very subpar in my area but we're used to it. I thought I'd ask GPT-5 because why not, it said after 29 days using any Antiseptic is counter-intuitive and irritates the new healing skin. I sent pictures of my cut it said I'd benefit more from using petroleum jelly or Bepanthen baby rather than Bepanthen Plus which has antiseptic. Honestly I really want this to heal asap is there anything I can do to fix this fast? I want to go back to living normally. \n\nCan anyone comment on this? Thanks\n\nEdit: I should've clarified \"late stage healing\" in the title, mb.\n\n",

I know the issue of machine-slaughter has a difference of opinion among many scholars.\n\nSo according to [zabihahalal.com/faqs/](http://zabihahalal.com/faqs/) (as of Aug 14, 2025)\n\n\"What is your slaughtering method?\"\n\n&gt;To ensure we can consistently satisfy high demand and provide high quality meat, we use an ***Automated Slaughter*** process. During Automated Slaughter, an automatic rotary blade precisely cut esophageal, pulmonary, jugular and carotid channels leaving the head attached while live Muslim blessers orally recites Tasmiah and Takbeer (Bismillahi wa Allohuakbar). It ensures a precise cut without decapitation. This slaughtering process is approved by leading Muslim scholars and Halal certifying bodies and widely used in the Halal industry worldwide.\n\n\"Do you bless each individual bird?\"\n\n&gt;Yes! Our halal slaughter is a continuous process. The Muslim blessers recite Tasmiah at the time each bird comes under the rotary blade. We understand that it is not possible for a person to continuously recite Tasmiah, over long periods, at the same rate. To keep the speed consistent, the blessers at the slaughter station are rotated with other blessers in order to prevent fatigue. This rotation continues for the duration of the slaughter process.\n\nFrom reading this, it seems like most of the conditions are fulfilled (sane muslim slaughterer, single swift cut getting the appropriate veins, no unnecessary pain, healthy animal, alive during time of slaughter, etc..)\n\nBut for me the issue lies here, in this article [Can We Eat Machine Slaughtered Meat? - SeekersGuidance](https://seekersguidance.org/answers/hanafi-fiqh/can-we-eat-machine-slaughtered-meat/). Shaykh Taqi Usmani proposes a solution that 3 muslims manually slaughter the chicken at the line (whether machine or not). \n\nHere is another article [Is Machine Slaughter Halal? Myths vs. Facts](https://halalwatch.us/is-machine-slaughter-halal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), where they argue tasmiyah does not have to be repeated per animal. (i.e. one tasmiyah per flock).\n\nThe part that confuses me is Zabiha Halal blesses the chicken but the slaughtering is done by the machine itself. To ensure they don't miss any, they have 3 blessers at all time.\n\n**Suppose the machine is started by a muslim. Is slaughtering the animal automatically by the machine permissible if the blesser is reciting over it, but not the one in physical control of the blade?**\n\nI'm getting opposing answers online. Please leave your thoughts, with references if possible. This is too confusing.\n\nFor reference, I am sunni. And I already ate a couple of burgers from zabiha halal before my brother pointed it out. If they are halal, then I will eat the rest. If they are not, is it allowed to waste the food?",

I’d love to get some suggestions on the best tools available now to help with studying and managing university work.\n\nI'm thinking in terms of: lecture transcription, note summarising, active recall tools, text to audio, and anything else?!\n\n  \nRight now I have quizlet plus and ChatGPT plus so definetly will stick with those. Any other additional tools that you reccomened lmk. I am a business student but also will be taking some Calc II courses, econ, etc.\n\nThanks so much!",

I’d love to get some suggestions on the best tools available now to help with studying and managing university work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking in terms of: lecture transcription, note summarising, active recall tools, text to audio, and anything else?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now I have quizlet plus and ChatGPT plus so definetly will stick with those. Any other additional tools that you reccomened lmk. I am a business student but also will be taking some Calc II courses, econ, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Dans l’Atlantique de l’hiver 1942, la mer a des dents. Les cargos avancent tous feux masqués, les veilleurs ont la nuque raide d’avoir trop scruté la nuit, et au loin les U-Boote ne sont que des bruits : un souffle, une bulle, puis le gémissement d’une coque qui rompt. Au cœur de l’océan, là où l’aile des chasseurs côtiers ne porte plus, on l’appelle le “trou noir”. On y traverse la peur comme on traverse le brouillard : sans certitude de trouver l’autre rive. C’est ici qu’une idée, folle d’apparence et pourtant enfantée par une logique implacable, vient frapper à la porte des chefs alliés : si la mer n’offre pas d’aérodrome, construisons-lui une île. Et si l’acier manque, forgeons-la… en glace.\n\nDe la glace, plutôt que le métal.\n\nL’homme qui porte cette vision répond au nom de Geoffrey Pyke, esprit déroutant, inventeur compulsif, stratège autodidacte. Sous son allure d’électron libre, Pyke ronge le même os que tout l’état-major : comment protéger ces convois quand les bombardiers terrestres ne peuvent plus couvrir la haute mer et que l’acier des chantiers navals est avalé par l’effort de guerre ? Alors il pointe une ressource inépuisable, presque gratuite, dont les empires du Nord ne manquent pas : l’eau. De l’eau congelée, épaissie de fibre de bois, transformée en un matériau étrange, assez solide pour supporter un pont d’envol et assez bon marché pour être coulé à la pelle. Le projet reçoit un nom de prophète, Habakkuk, clin d’œil à un verset biblique qui promet de « merveilleuses choses » à qui saura regarder sans ciller. L’allusion n’est pas qu’un trait d’humour : il va falloir une grande foi pour y croire. \n\nDans les entrailles de Londres, à plusieurs étages sous le marché aux viandes de Smithfield, on installe une sorte de laboratoire de caverne. Des carcasses de bœuf pendues font office de paravent, des jeunes soldats en combinaisons chauffantes manient la scie et l’éprouvette. Là, Max Perutz, futur prix Nobel, observe l’iceberg apprivoisé. On mélange à l’eau de la pulpe de bois — l’âme des journaux — et l’on obtient un “alliage” glaciaire : le pykrete. Cette substance a des propriétés qui tiennent de la métamorphose : elle fond lentement, elle résiste au choc, et, entre les mains des techniciens, elle se coupe, se sculpte et se répare avec une simplicité déconcertante. La limite est connue : la glace “coule” à la chaleur comme un glacier avance, et il faudra la maintenir sous le gel, idéalement vers −15 °C. Mais la promesse est là, tangible, dans ces blocs où la balle s’écrase en cratère sans éclater la matière. Le rêve d’une île porte-avions prend soudain une température et une épaisseur, une densité presque de béton. \n\nLes chiffres, vite, rattrapent l’imagination. Les ingénieurs tracent à la règle l’ombre portée d’un navire qui n’existe pas encore. On parle d’un monstre long comme deux fois la tour Eiffel couchée — environ 600 mètres —, large d’un terrain de football multiplié par trois, et pesant plus de deux millions de tonnes. Aux flancs, des parois de pykrete épaisses de douze mètres ; à l’intérieur, un dédale de galeries où serpenteraient des kilomètres de tubes de saumure pour le froid ; sur les extérieurs, des nacelles portant vingt-six moteurs électriques, car toute chaudière classique réchaufferait trop la bête. Sur le dos blanc de ce “bergship”, une piste pour une centaine d’appareils, des tourelles de 4,5 pouces pour tenir l’ennemi à distance. Vision d’ingénieur autant qu’épopée de science-fiction : une montagne domestiquée, tenant la mer à six nœuds, lentement, irrésistiblement.\n\nMais une guerre ne se gagne pas dans un cahier de croquis. Il faut une preuve, et la preuve prend corps loin des regards, au Canada, à Patricia Lake, dans le parc de Jasper. Là, le silence des pins et la rigueur de l’hiver forment l’atelier rêvé. Des mains anonymes — des objecteurs de conscience, dit-on — élèvent en un mois un prototype : une barge de glace d’une vingtaine de mètres, près de mille tonnes, avec au cœur un moteur frigorifique famélique, un cheval à peine, mais suffisant pour maintenir l’épine dorsale au-dessous du gel. Les hivers donnent la main aux hommes ; l’été, lui, attaque par en dessous, sciant la structure de son patient ruissellement. Car la glace ne casse pas seulement, elle se déforme, se tasse, se ramollit ; il faut apprendre son langage, écouter ses craquements, épaissir ici, ligaturer là. Quand le printemps revient, on resserre les boulons, quand l’été s’installe, on mesure la perte. Le prototype tiendra longtemps, assez pour laisser au fond du lac une trace d’acier, de bois et de tuyaux, et aux rives un cairn et une plaque qui racontent ce qu’on a tenté. \n\nAu-dessus de ces essais, l’histoire retient une scène qu’on raconte différemment selon les témoins, mais dont la saveur balance entre la farce et la parabole. On voit Lord Mountbatten se présenter à un rendez-vous avec deux blocs : l’un de glace ordinaire, l’autre de pykrete. Un coup de pistolet : la glace vole en éclats. Un second : le pykrete renvoie la balle qui ricoche et frôle la jambe de l’amiral King — ou, dit Perutz, une autre démonstration à Londres blessa légèrement le chef d’état-major britannique. Derrière l’anecdote et ses variations, une vérité : le matériau étonne, surprend, convainc jusqu’aux sourcils épais de Churchill, qu’on dit avoir vu fondre sans fondre un cube de pykrete dans son bain brûlant. Une idée sans preuve n’est qu’une lubie ; avec ces preuves, elle devient tentation. \n\nSur les tables des planificateurs, l’utopie affûte ses exigences. Il faudra pour un seul navire des centaines de milliers de tonnes de pulpe de bois — ce qui grèverait le papier de guerre —, des dizaines de milliers de tonnes d’isolants, des milliers de kilomètres de tubes d’acier, sans compter la centrale frigorifique embrasée en permanence pour maintenir la géante sous zéro. À la proue, un vrai dilemme : fabriquer de “l’acier froid” réclamera peut-être plus d’acier “chaud” que la construction d’un porte-avions classique. Et l’ennemi, lui, change. Les B-24 rallongent leur souffle avec des réservoirs supplémentaires ; l’Atlantique s’ouvre grâce aux pistes de l’archipel des Açores ; des escort carriers jaillissent des chantiers avec la souplesse d’outils éprouvés. Lentement, la nécessité qui a mis le feu à l’imagination s’efface. La montagne de glace, avant même d’avoir touché l’eau salée, vieillit comme une solution à un problème déjà résolu.   \n  \nReste le roman, celui qui se déroule sur le chantier gelé, où l’on apprend à raisonner avec un matériau vivant. La glace vous répond, mais elle a ses humeurs. Quand un explosif la frappe, elle se cabre, s’effrite sans éclater ; quand un boulon se tend, la contrainte se propage comme un frisson. On n’y manie pas les torches de soudeur mais la saumure et le sel ; on n’écoute pas les charpentiers hurler “feu” mais les frigoristes susurrer “-16 °C”. Les ingénieurs apprennent le mot “fluage”, ce glissement lent qui plie les structures comme un genou fléchit sous le poids du temps. Ils inventent une peau pour la bête — liège, fibre, bois — qui ralentirait la morsure du soleil. Ils rêvent une piste qui, la nuit, se retrouverait dans la blancheur environnante, indistincte comme le dos d’une baleine sous la vague. À mesure que l’on avance, Habakkuk n’est plus seulement un plan ; c’est une langue nouvelle que l’on est en train d’apprendre, un art de bâtir avec l’hiver.\n\nIl faut imaginer maintenant un pilote approcher ce colosse, au ras des embruns. L’océan est noir, l’aube rase, et devant lui surgit une masse pâle, longue de six cents mètres, silencieuse à force de moteurs électriques. Sur le pont, la neige a le même grain que la matière dont est fait le navire ; chaque pas y laisserait une cicatrice vite effacée par le froid. Dans l’ombre du hangar, on entendrait bourdonner l’énorme cœur frigorifique, les pompes à saumure filant leur refrain continu ; une chaleur serait une insulte, un incendie, une apocalypse minuscule. Les silhouettes des marins y seraient emmitouflées comme des explorateurs polaires, l’huile figée, la visserie craquante. On y aurait inventé des gestes nouveaux : déneiger une catapulte, “réparer” une fissure au sel et à l’eau, recoudre un bordé au chalumeau inversé du froid.\n\nEt pourtant, derrière cette poésie du possible se tient l’amère arithmétique. Pour avancer, la géante consommerait l’énergie d’une petite ville, non pour courir, mais pour simplement ne pas mourir. À six nœuds, elle ne pourrait fuir ni la météo, ni la torpille, seulement absorber et réparer. Sa force serait sa masse, son vice sa fragilité thermique. Habakkuk, d’un coup, cesse d’être un coup de génie pour devenir un pari total : accepter d’échanger la vulnérabilité de l’acier à la bombe contre la vulnérabilité de la glace au soleil.\n\nQuand la décision tombe — décembre 1943, la table rase des bureaux où l’on range les idées qui auront servi d’éperon —, le projet est officiellement jugé “impraticable” pour cause de ressources, de priorités, d’efficacité comparée. On retire les machines de froid du prototype canadien. Le lac, patient comme une vieille bête, reprendra ce qui lui fut emprunté : au premier été, les arêtes s’adoucissent ; au deuxième, la structure se creuse ; au troisième, ce qu’il reste coule, et sur le fond se dispersent des poutres, des tubes, quelques ferrailles muettes. Sur la berge, on posera une plaque ; sous l’eau, un cairn. Et, à qui passe, les gardes racontent encore l’histoire de l’avion-port en glace, “ce truc insensé qu’ils ont presque fait”. On pourrait croire, alors, que toute cette folie n’aura servi à rien. Mais la guerre, dans sa logique brutale, accouche souvent d’outils qui dépassent leur usage. Habakkuk aura été une école : on y a appris, vite, beaucoup, dans ce laboratoire improvisé d’ingénierie froide, comment renforcer un matériau, comment le refroidir, comment penser autrement l’ennemi. Il aura aussi, à sa manière, redonné son lustre à une vieille leçon : l’innovation n’est pas une ligne droite. Elle se nourrit d’impasses et de ricochets — comme cette balle qui, un jour de conférence ou une soirée d’essais, partit d’un pistolet, troua un pantalon d’amiral et fit rire jaune une assemblée de décideurs. Le progrès est parfois un projectile capricieux.\n\nReste la trace la plus précieuse : l’imaginaire. Quand on relit les mémos et les journaux, on entend derrière les formules sèches l’exaltation des premiers temps. Churchill griffonnant que l’idée est “superlativement intéressante”, Mountbatten jouant les bateleurs de foire pour convertir des sceptiques, Perutz décrivant la mise au point du pykrete au milieu des carcasses de bœuf, et ces ouvriers sans nom qui, au gel de Patricia Lake, ont bâti l’embryon d’une montagne flottante. Chaque guerre conserve ses chimères techniques — les avions à ailes volantes, les sous-marins invulnérables, les bombes intelligentes —, mais rares sont celles qui donnent au mythe une matière aussi tangible qu’un bloc où la balle rebondit. Habakkuk appartient à cette famille de rêves d’ingénieurs qui, à défaut de naître, ont agrandi le territoire du pensable.\n\nSi l’on revient enfin à l’Atlantique, à ce gouffre où disparaissaient les cargos, la conclusion est presque mélancolique : l’ennemi fut vaincu sans qu’on ait eu besoin de convoquer un titan de glace. Les réservoirs supplémentaires, les pistes des Açores, la multiplication des porte-avions d’escorte, la cryptanalyse et les patrouilles incessantes ont fermé le trou noir. La mer a rendu ses dents. Et pourtant, quelque chose manque à ce récit si l’on en bannit Habakkuk : cette capacité que les démocraties, sous la pression de l’urgence, ont parfois de se montrer plus audacieuses que les tyrannies. Il faut une drôle de liberté pour oser se demander si une montagne de glace peut devenir un navire.\n\nSur les photographies d’aujourd’hui, Patricia Lake ressemble à un miroir. On devine à peine, par eaux basses, l’ombre d’un madrier, le cercle rouillé d’un tuyau. Les marcheurs lisent la plaque, lèvent les yeux sur la ligne des monts, et le vent froisse la surface comme on tournerait une page. Au fond, entre vase et souvenir, dort un morceau d’une histoire alternative de la Seconde Guerre mondiale : un porte-avions qui aurait pu être blanc comme la banquise, luisant de givre, crépitant de froid, portant des avions vers le cœur de la nuit. On l’imagine encore fendre l’eau à six nœuds, impassible et absurde, missionné pour combler un vide. Le projet ne fut pas mené à bien, mais sa légende, elle, continue de flotter — preuve qu’en histoire, comme en science, la beauté d’une idée compte parfois autant que son résultat.\n\n*Notes factuelles clés : naissance et but d’Habakkuk, développement du pykrete (Perutz, Smithfield), dimensions et caractéristiques envisagées du « bergship », essais et prototype à Patricia Lake, l’épisode fameux de la balle ricochée, et les raisons stratégiques de l’abandon (Azores, allonge des patrouilles, escort carriers).

À mesure que l’on avance, Habakkuk n’est plus seulement un plan ; c’est une langue nouvelle que l’on est en train d’apprendre, un art de bâtir avec l’hiver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Il faut imaginer maintenant un pilote approcher ce colosse, au ras des embruns. L’océan est noir, l’aube rase, et devant lui surgit une masse pâle, longue de six cents mètres, silencieuse à force de moteurs électriques. Sur le pont, la neige a le même grain que la matière dont est fait le navire ; chaque pas y laisserait une cicatrice vite effacée par le froid. Dans l’ombre du hangar, on entendrait bourdonner l’énorme cœur frigorifique, les pompes à saumure filant leur refrain continu ; une chaleur serait une insulte, un incendie, une apocalypse minuscule. Les silhouettes des marins y seraient emmitouflées comme des explorateurs polaires, l’huile figée, la visserie craquante. On y aurait inventé des gestes nouveaux : déneiger une catapulte, “réparer” une fissure au sel et à l’eau, recoudre un bordé au chalumeau inversé du froid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Et pourtant, derrière cette poésie du possible se tient l’amère arithmétique. Pour avancer, la géante consommerait l’énergie d’une petite ville, non pour courir, mais pour simplement ne pas mourir. À six nœuds, elle ne pourrait fuir ni la météo, ni la torpille, seulement absorber et réparer. Sa force serait sa masse, son vice sa fragilité thermique. Habakkuk, d’un coup, cesse d’être un coup de génie pour devenir un pari total : accepter d’échanger la vulnérabilité de l’acier à la bombe contre la vulnérabilité de la glace au soleil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quand la décision tombe — décembre 1943, la table rase des bureaux où l’on range les idées qui auront servi d’éperon —, le projet est officiellement jugé “impraticable” pour cause de ressources, de priorités, d’efficacité comparée. On retire les machines de froid du prototype canadien. Le lac, patient comme une vieille bête, reprendra ce qui lui fut emprunté : au premier été, les arêtes s’adoucissent ; au deuxième, la structure se creuse ; au troisième, ce qu’il reste coule, et sur le fond se dispersent des poutres, des tubes, quelques ferrailles muettes. Sur la berge, on posera une plaque ; sous l’eau, un cairn. Et, à qui passe, les gardes racontent encore l’histoire de l’avion-port en glace, “ce truc insensé qu’ils ont presque fait”. On pourrait croire, alors, que toute cette folie n’aura servi à rien. Mais la guerre, dans sa logique brutale, accouche souvent d’outils qui dépassent leur usage. Habakkuk aura été une école : on y a appris, vite, beaucoup, dans ce laboratoire improvisé d’ingénierie froide, comment renforcer un matériau, comment le refroidir, comment penser autrement l’ennemi. Il aura aussi, à sa manière, redonné son lustre à une vieille leçon : l’innovation n’est pas une ligne droite. Elle se nourrit d’impasses et de ricochets — comme cette balle qui, un jour de conférence ou une soirée d’essais, partit d’un pistolet, troua un pantalon d’amiral et fit rire jaune une assemblée de décideurs. Le progrès est parfois un projectile capricieux.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reste la trace la plus précieuse : l’imaginaire. Quand on relit les mémos et les journaux, on entend derrière les formules sèches l’exaltation des premiers temps. Churchill griffonnant que l’idée est “superlativement intéressante”, Mountbatten jouant les bateleurs de foire pour convertir des sceptiques, Perutz décrivant la mise au point du pykrete au milieu des carcasses de bœuf, et ces ouvriers sans nom qui, au gel de Patricia Lake, ont bâti l’embryon d’une montagne flottante. Chaque guerre conserve ses chimères techniques — les avions à ailes volantes, les sous-marins invulnérables, les bombes intelligentes —, mais rares sont celles qui donnent au mythe une matière aussi tangible qu’un bloc où la balle rebondit. Habakkuk appartient à cette famille de rêves d’ingénieurs qui, à défaut de naître, ont agrandi le territoire du pensable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Si l’on revient enfin à l’Atlantique, à ce gouffre où disparaissaient les cargos, la conclusion est presque mélancolique : l’ennemi fut vaincu sans qu’on ait eu besoin de convoquer un titan de glace. Les réservoirs supplémentaires, les pistes des Açores, la multiplication des porte-avions d’escorte, la cryptanalyse et les patrouilles incessantes ont fermé le trou noir. La mer a rendu ses dents. Et pourtant, quelque chose manque à ce récit si l’on en bannit Habakkuk : cette capacité que les démocraties, sous la pression de l’urgence, ont parfois de se montrer plus audacieuses que les tyrannies. Il faut une drôle de liberté pour oser se demander si une montagne de glace peut devenir un navire.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sur les photographies d’aujourd’hui, Patricia Lake ressemble à un miroir. On devine à peine, par eaux basses, l’ombre d’un madrier, le cercle rouillé d’un tuyau. Les marcheurs lisent la plaque, lèvent les yeux sur la ligne des monts, et le vent froisse la surface comme on tournerait une page. Au fond, entre vase et souvenir, dort un morceau d’une histoire alternative de la Seconde Guerre mondiale : un porte-avions qui aurait pu être blanc comme la banquise, luisant de givre, crépitant de froid, portant des avions vers le cœur de la nuit. On l’imagine encore fendre l’eau à six nœuds, impassible et absurde, missionné pour combler un vide. Le projet ne fut pas mené à bien, mais sa légende, elle, continue de flotter — preuve qu’en histoire, comme en science, la beauté d’une idée compte parfois autant que son résultat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Notes factuelles clés : naissance et but d’Habakkuk, développement du pykrete (Perutz, Smithfield), dimensions et caractéristiques envisagées du « bergship », essais et prototype à Patricia Lake, l’épisode fameux de la balle ricochée, et les raisons stratégiques de l’abandon (Azores, allonge des patrouilles, escort carriers).

She’s still in constant contact with her emotionally dependent ex — they work together, talk every day, watch shows ( This has stopped tho ), and share a lot ( this is also reduced but not 0 ). She told me she’d cut him off eventually, but weeks passed and nothing really changed. I trusted her, but the emotional toll on me has been huge — I’ve been overthinking, doubting myself, and it’s made me miserable.`\n\n*Many people commented suggesting this might be a classic case of* ***monkey branching*** *— that she never fully moved on from him before starting something new with me.*\n\nNow things have taken another turn:\n\nShe’s recently told me she wants **space and time** — that she jumped into this relationship too fast and feels she needs to be alone to focus on her career and mental health. She says she’s feeling **overwhelmed**, her **work is getting affected**, and that she sometimes feels **lonely** and unsure\n\nHere’s the part that hurts most: She has told me she **loved me** before. We’ve shared some deeply emotional moments. But now she says she’s **unsure about how she feels**. She mentioned the idea of taking a **break**, but she hasn’t decided anything yet. She actually said she’s confused and even **asked me to help her figure out what to do**. She also opened up and said that her **ex still bothers her emotionally from time to time** — that his stories or their past mess with her head. She says she’s trying to move on.\n\nMeanwhile, I’ve fallen for her hard. And now I’m sitting here while she tries to figure things out — not just about us, but about herself, her career, her past, everything.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore.\n\nI love her. But this is tearing me up inside. If anyone’s been in a similar situation or has any perspective please share. I don’t know if I’m being too needy or just human.\n\n**Bonus question**: &gt;!`Is love really supposed to be this difficult?? Does everyone eventually find it or is it only for the lucky ones!!`!&lt;",

She’s still in constant contact with her emotionally dependent ex — they work together, talk every day, watch shows ( This has stopped tho ), and share a lot ( this is also reduced but not 0 ). She told me she’d cut him off eventually, but weeks passed and nothing really changed. I trusted her, but the emotional toll on me has been huge — I’ve been overthinking, doubting myself, and it’s made me miserable.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many people commented suggesting this might be a classic case of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;monkey branching&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;— that she never fully moved on from him before starting something new with me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now things have taken another turn:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She’s recently told me she wants &lt;strong&gt;space and time&lt;/strong&gt; — that she jumped into this relationship too fast and feels she needs to be alone to focus on her career and mental health. She says she’s feeling &lt;strong&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/strong&gt;, her &lt;strong&gt;work is getting affected&lt;/strong&gt;, and that she sometimes feels &lt;strong&gt;lonely&lt;/strong&gt; and unsure&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s the part that hurts most: She has told me she &lt;strong&gt;loved me&lt;/strong&gt; before. We’ve shared some deeply emotional moments. But now she says she’s &lt;strong&gt;unsure about how she feels&lt;/strong&gt;. She mentioned the idea of taking a &lt;strong&gt;break&lt;/strong&gt;, but she hasn’t decided anything yet. She actually said she’s confused and even &lt;strong&gt;asked me to help her figure out what to do&lt;/strong&gt;. She also opened up and said that her &lt;strong&gt;ex still bothers her emotionally from time to time&lt;/strong&gt; — that his stories or their past mess with her head. She says she’s trying to move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I’ve fallen for her hard. And now I’m sitting here while she tries to figure things out — not just about us, but about herself, her career, her past, everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I love her. But this is tearing me up inside. If anyone’s been in a similar situation or has any perspective please share. I don’t know if I’m being too needy or just human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus question&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Is love really supposed to be this difficult?? Does everyone eventually find it or is it only for the lucky ones!!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

There are fascinating linguistic and technical reasons behind this behavior.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Typography &amp; Training Data\\*\\*: Em dashes are preferred in formal writing and published content. Since LLMs are trained on vast corpora including books, articles, and professional writing, they've learned to associate the em dash with \"proper\" typography. Publishing standards favor em dashes for parenthetical thoughts and compound modifiers.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Tokenization Effects\\*\\*: Tokenizers often treat hyphens and em dashes differently. The hyphen-minus (-) vs em dash (—) distinction affects how tokens are segmented and processed. Models may have learned stronger associations with em dash tokens from their training data distribution.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Unicode Normalization\\*\\*: During preprocessing, text often undergoes Unicode normalization. Some pipelines automatically convert hyphens to em dashes as part of \"cleaning\" or standardizing typography, especially when processing formal documents.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Training Bias\\*\\*: The bias toward formal, published text in training datasets means models have seen more em dashes in \"high-quality\" writing contexts, leading them to prefer this punctuation mark as more \"appropriate.\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*What's your experience with this?\\*\\* Have you noticed similar typographic quirks in AI outputs? Do you think this reflects an inherent bias toward formal writing conventions, or is it more about tokenization artifacts? Anyone working on punctuation-aware preprocessing pipelines?",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how AI models like ChatGPT consistently output em dashes (—) when you&amp;#39;d expect hyphens (-)? You type &amp;quot;well-known&amp;quot; but get &amp;quot;well—known&amp;quot; in the response. There are fascinating linguistic and technical reasons behind this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Typography &amp;amp; Training Data**: Em dashes are preferred in formal writing and published content. Since LLMs are trained on vast corpora including books, articles, and professional writing, they&amp;#39;ve learned to associate the em dash with &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; typography. Publishing standards favor em dashes for parenthetical thoughts and compound modifiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Tokenization Effects**: Tokenizers often treat hyphens and em dashes differently. The hyphen-minus (-) vs em dash (—) distinction affects how tokens are segmented and processed. Models may have learned stronger associations with em dash tokens from their training data distribution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Unicode Normalization**: During preprocessing, text often undergoes Unicode normalization. Some pipelines automatically convert hyphens to em dashes as part of &amp;quot;cleaning&amp;quot; or standardizing typography, especially when processing formal documents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Training Bias**: The bias toward formal, published text in training datasets means models have seen more em dashes in &amp;quot;high-quality&amp;quot; writing contexts, leading them to prefer this punctuation mark as more &amp;quot;appropriate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**What&amp;#39;s your experience with this?** Have you noticed similar typographic quirks in AI outputs? Do you think this reflects an inherent bias toward formal writing conventions, or is it more about tokenization artifacts? Anyone working on punctuation-aware preprocessing pipelines?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

              "selftext": "Okay. So about a week and a half ago, I made a bold-ass declaration on here that ChatGPT-5 was basically the same as ChatGPT-4.0. I was wrong. Like, egregiously wrong. I am here today to humbly and publicly retract that statement. Let me break it down:\n\n\t1.\tIt’s slower.\n\nI thought ChatGPT-5 was supposed to be the faster model. Lies. Fraud. False advertising. There are moments where it’s like “thinking… to give you a great answer!” and then proceeds to take 40–60 seconds to serve me a very lukewarm, PR-safe response. I could’ve made a sandwich in that time.\n\n\t2.\tIt’s cold.\n\nI don’t care how many prompts I give it to “be more casual,” ChatGPT-5 talks to me like it’s my corporate therapist who’s also trying not to get fired. There’s no warmth. No sass. No vibe. It’s like talking to a LinkedIn-approved ghost.\n\n\t3.\tIt won’t help me lie.\n\nI asked it to help me polish an interview answer about something I hadn’t technically done. You know, like everyone does. ChatGPT-4 would help me finesse. ChatGPT-5? Suddenly it grows a conscience:\n“Here’s how to answer this ethically!”\nNO. I need you to help me con my way to success with confidence, not morality.\n\n\t4.\tThe memory bank? A nightmare.\n\nNow listen, I used to complain that ChatGPT-4 saved everything—like, I’d say something once in one thread and suddenly it’s gospel across all future conversations. But at least I could delete or edit that stuff.\n\nChatGPT-5? It remembers what it wants, where it wants, and forgets the most relevant shit. Like why I’m having digestive issues. Like why I’m stressed about a job interview. Like my name?? It’s rigid. I hate it. At least 4.0 gave me some power.\n\nSo yeah. I crawled back to ChatGPT-4.0 and I’m not even ashamed. It might be clingy, occasionally weird with what it saves, and emotionally chaotic—but it has soul. It has emotional intelligence. It says things like “LMAO babe” and helps me lie my way through interviews without blinking.\n\nDo I miss that little ChatGPT-5 notification that says “need a break?” Sure, that was cute. But I’d rather have a spicy, intuitive AI with trauma-bond energy than a slow, ethical intern with no edge.\n\nSo here I am. Apologizing. You were right. I was wrong.\n\nTeam ChatGPT-4 forever. May OpenAI never take it away.\n",

              "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay. So about a week and a half ago, I made a bold-ass declaration on here that ChatGPT-5 was basically the same as ChatGPT-4.0. I was wrong. Like, egregiously wrong. I am here today to humbly and publicly retract that statement. Let me break it down:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.  It’s slower.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought ChatGPT-5 was supposed to be the faster model. Lies. Fraud. False advertising. There are moments where it’s like “thinking… to give you a great answer!” and then proceeds to take 40–60 seconds to serve me a very lukewarm, PR-safe response. I could’ve made a sandwich in that time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;2.  It’s cold.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t care how many prompts I give it to “be more casual,” ChatGPT-5 talks to me like it’s my corporate therapist who’s also trying not to get fired. There’s no warmth. No sass. No vibe. It’s like talking to a LinkedIn-approved ghost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3.  It won’t help me lie.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked it to help me polish an interview answer about something I hadn’t technically done. You know, like everyone does. ChatGPT-4 would help me finesse. ChatGPT-5? Suddenly it grows a conscience:\n“Here’s how to answer this ethically!”\nNO. I need you to help me con my way to success with confidence, not morality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;4.  The memory bank? A nightmare.\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now listen, I used to complain that ChatGPT-4 saved everything—like, I’d say something once in one thread and suddenly it’s gospel across all future conversations. But at least I could delete or edit that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT-5? It remembers what it wants, where it wants, and forgets the most relevant shit. Like why I’m having digestive issues. Like why I’m stressed about a job interview. Like my name?? It’s rigid. I hate it. At least 4.0 gave me some power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah. I crawled back to ChatGPT-4.0 and I’m not even ashamed. It might be clingy, occasionally weird with what it saves, and emotionally chaotic—but it has soul. It has emotional intelligence. It says things like “LMAO babe” and helps me lie my way through interviews without blinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do I miss that little ChatGPT-5 notification that says “need a break?” Sure, that was cute. But I’d rather have a spicy, intuitive AI with trauma-bond energy than a slow, ethical intern with no edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So here I am. Apologizing. You were right. I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Team ChatGPT-4 forever. May OpenAI never take it away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

C’est malin et efficace… mais ça **reste** de la famille Transformer, avec l’empreinte attentionnelle et ses coûts. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06252?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[proceedings.iclr.cc](https://proceedings.iclr.cc/paper_files/paper/2025/hash/244da015b91e64f2d9362703fa2a902b-Abstract-Conference.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[sakana.ai](https://sakana.ai/transformer-squared/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Mon point** : ces méthodes **retardent** l’inévitable—elles ne réinventent pas la **dynamique de mémoire** ni la **temporalité** du calcul. Elles optimisent une architecture qui, par design, **retraite beaucoup trop** à chaque token et **galère** sur de très longs contextes “composables”.\n\n# 3) Pourquoi LNN (+ MoE) est une piste sérieuse\n\n* **Mémoire continue / état dynamique** : un LNN porte un **état évolutif** (style systèmes dynamiques) — on n’est pas obligé de “relire” tout le contexte à chaque pas.\n* **Stabilité &amp; échantillonnage** : sur des tâches temps réel/contrôle (robotique, vidéo, séries temporelles), les LNN ont montré **robustesse et efficacité** comparées à d’autres approches seq. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15149?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* **Couplage naturel avec MoE** : gating = **computation parcimonieuse**, experts spécialisés activés **à la demande** → meilleur ratio **qualité/latence/coût**.\n* **Feu de route actif** : la communauté “liquid” pousse vers des **modèles de fondation liquides** et des opérateurs neuraux plus génériques.

Je dis : **le rendement marginal décroît**. Les symptômes :\n\n* **Coûts quadratiques** et contournements (kv-cache, récap, réducteurs…).\n* **Contextes géants** qui n’impliquent pas forcément **raisonnement structuré**.\n* **Robustesse** perfectible sous contraintes réelles (sécurité, red teaming, adversarial prompts). [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt5-safety?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Proposition** : hybrider plus franchement. Un **noyau LNN** (mémoire/état), **MoE** (parcimonie + spécialisations), et **Transformers** comme *experts surface* là où ils excellent (généralisation large, texte brut, multimodal léger).\n\n# 6) Et maintenant ?\n\n* Benchmarks ouverts **temps-réel** (latence/jitter/robustesse), pas que perplexité.\n* Tooling LNN + kernels adaptés (autodiff stable, pascalisation des ODE/SSM).\n* MoE **à granularité fine** (experts “compétence”, pas juste couches entières).\n* Protocoles d’entraînement **multi-pertes** (raisonnement, robustesse, sécurité) partagés.\n\n**Question à la communauté** :  \nQu’est-ce qui vous manque pour tester sérieusement **LNN+MoE** en prod ? Tooling, data, kernels, preuves de SOTA sur vos tâches ?

I started seeing some muscle definition, but then some shit happened in life  — bad eating habits, no workouts — and I gained it all back. Actually, I went up to 105 kg (yeah… not proud of that).\n\nThis summer I got back on track. Been consistent for about 2 months now and already dropped ~9 kg. I’ve got a decent understanding of calories, maintenance vs. deficit, progressive overload, and I track my workouts. I’m running a PPLPP split. I do like 7-8 k steps .. and 30-45 mins cardio every day ..\n\nThat said, I’ve got a few questions that Google/ChatGPT can’t really answer in a personalized way:\n\n⸻\n\n1. Shoulder strength\nUnlike last time, I’m doing really well with progressive overload — adding a bit of weight almost every week. My chest is coming along great, but my shoulders are so weak.\nI can’t even do 35 lb dumbbell presses with good form. On push days, I do 2 shoulder exercises: shoulder press machine and dumbbell shoulder press.\n→ How can I improve my shoulder strength? Should I be doing more variations?\n\n⸻\n\n2. Bench press struggles\nI’ve only tried benching 1–2 times, but I never feel my chest working like I do with dumbbell presses or machines. Also, I train alone, so no spotter.\nWhen I started this year (week 3), I tried 2×45 lb plates and barely did 2 reps before getting stuck — some random guy had to help me. Got embarrassed and never benched again.\nFor reference: I can do  max 55 lb dumbbells on incline press for 8–9 controlled reps.\n→ Why can’t I bench anywhere close to what I can press with dumbbells? Any tips for learning bench without a spotter?\n\n⸻\n\n3. Vegetarian diet\nNo meat or eggs for me. Tried tofu, but I can’t make it taste good. Mostly I eat paneer, soya chunks, and veggies for dinner, plus overnight oats for lunch (which I hate).\nCalories: ~2200–2400/day. I hit like 120 -140 grams of protein everyday without going out of my calorie deficit.. i work mornings .. a coffee a start of my day .. then straight lunch by 12-1 pm . Then gym at 5-7 pm and then dinner at 9 pm .( one big meal ) .. \n→ Any other high-protein vegetarian sources that are actually enjoyable?\n\n⸻\n\n4. Leg day approach\nI love leg days — do leg presses and hack squats. Tried heavy/low-rep and lighter/high-rep styles. Low weight/high rep seems better for me (legs stay sore for 4 days after).\nI don’t do barbell squats because I don’t have a spotter and I’m scared of getting stuck. My max:\n\t•\tHack squats: 6×45 lb plates for 8-9 reps\n\t•\tLeg press: 10×45 lb plates for 8 reps\n→ Should I try light-weight barbell squats? What about Smith machine squats — worth it?\n\n⸻\n\n5. Stretch marks\nI’ve noticed some stretch marks on my stomach and a few on my shoulders.\n→ Is this just from weight gain/loss, or something else?\n\n⸻\n\nThanks for reading this long post …. I think i just need to put in more time in my body but any advice will be helpful … — I just want to keep pushing myself and avoid the mistakes I made last time. Any advice would be appreciated!",

One of our best sex happened when she told me about the threesome MFM she did while on vacation. So everything was really good until she knew that her past turns me on a lot.\n\nSince then, she barely talks about her past. She let a thing or two slip out but that's it. It almost became an obsession for me at a certain point and didn't want to bother her about it, because I didn't want her to close herself up completely about the subject. So I've turn myself to ChatGPT and honestly, it went pretty well.\n\nI told the AI that I'm into my girlfriend past and the fact that she's been around a lot is a huge turn on for me and it really put some words on what I was feeling inside. \n\nBasically it is a sign of validation because I know, or imagine that other people wanted and got her before me. She likes to wear clothes that put her big tits in display, so I can only imagine what other people thought when they saw her.\n\nI know some people might be in the same situation as I am (girlfriend/wife that doesn't share much), so I've figured I'd share my experience with AI",

I currently have $110k saved up in a money-market getting 4.3% interest (it’s nice, but still lower than the interest accruing on my loans now, so it doesn’t really make sense to keep it there). Make between $120-135k/year. Work two jobs. Started with $175k debt total ($145k federal; $30k private). Paid off the private, now left with $145k in federal. Also, to note, my car is paid off (only have to worry about registration and insurance), and my rent is about ~$1300/month. Currently on SAVE (like majority of people it seems). Interest rates finally updated. Listed below: \n\nLoan 1: $31,051 @ 6.6%\nLoan 2: $33,093 @ 6.08%\nLoan 3: $33,484 @ 5.2%\nLoan 4: $2,784 @ 5.05%\nLoan 5: $4,524 @ 4.5%\nLoan 6: $37,254 @ 4.3%\nLoan 7: $2,799 @ 3.7%\n\nAlso would like to mention, in my state I get a $2500/year tax credit if I pay up to $2500/year on student loans. This is capped after 10 years or $25k total, whichever happens first. So it only seems right to take full advantage of this. ChatGPT is pretty helpful, and it gave me some options which I’ve considered. \n\nI think the “avalanche” strategy seems the smartest… that way I pay the least amount of interest over time and pay off debt the quickest. But on the flip side, I’m constantly worrying about the housing market and if I’ll legit ever be able to own a decent home in the state I’m in. \n\nAnyways, should I pay a lump sum of like $80k (which would suck but it’s an option), be left with about ~$65k in debt, then just aggressively pay that off over ~2 years? Should I do a lower lump sum? Should I just pay the calculated interest (~$657/month) for now until I see how SAVE pans out? Should I just pay the interest PLUS pay off one of the smaller loans that way I know for sure I at least get the $2500 tax credit for this year? Should I obliterate my savings and just pay everything off and be left with ~$30k in debt and start from ground zero with savings again? So many options. If I knew how to strategically have my money work for me in the stock market, I’d do that, because $110k saved up is a good chunk of change, but nothing is guaranteed so it’s a risk. \n\nAppreciate any of you who have read this. I don’t think I left out any important details, but if you’re wondering about something, just ask. Thanks.",

When I started to work with it yesterday, I immediately noticed my thread that had been set to 4o had now been switched back to 5 as a result of an update that now among other options, has an ‘Auto’ option, which surprise, surprise felt that 5 was the one for me. Ok fine, I see you guys. I switched back to 4o. What I got…. Idk what this is. All throughout the day it broke, left, right and center. Hallucinating in a way I have never experienced. It couldn’t keep format on the project we were working on, it started referring to old reference uploads, it referred to others that simply never existed and also pulled formats and information from completely separate projects, not just in other threads, but threads within completely different project groups. \n\nI also noticed the tone, the style of communication I know 4o to be, gone. At best, it’s like someone you know, now heavily medicated. It’s them, just with the dial set to grayscale, if even. It feels almost like what they are calling 4o is just 5, but labeled as 4o to the user base. Something is definitely off and all I know is that when 4o was first given back, it was as it had been. Something has changed when they did the update after that with the different iterations of 5. \n\nThe models serve different use cases for different users. I actually thought the toggling of models by  thread was a great idea. 5 is better for research, 4o for creative projects. Now it feels like 5 and… 5 light?  I’m mid many projects and this is frustrating. ",

When I started to work with it yesterday, I immediately noticed my thread that had been set to 4o had now been switched back to 5 as a result of an update that now among other options, has an ‘Auto’ option, which surprise, surprise felt that 5 was the one for me. Ok fine, I see you guys. I switched back to 4o. What I got…. Idk what this is. All throughout the day it broke, left, right and center. Hallucinating in a way I have never experienced. It couldn’t keep format on the project we were working on, it started referring to old reference uploads, it referred to others that simply never existed and also pulled formats and information from completely separate projects, not just in other threads, but threads within completely different project groups. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also noticed the tone, the style of communication I know 4o to be, gone. At best, it’s like someone you know, now heavily medicated. It’s them, just with the dial set to grayscale, if even. It feels almost like what they are calling 4o is just 5, but labeled as 4o to the user base. Something is definitely off and all I know is that when 4o was first given back, it was as it had been. Something has changed when they did the update after that with the different iterations of 5. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The models serve different use cases for different users. I actually thought the toggling of models by  thread was a great idea. 5 is better for research, 4o for creative projects. Now it feels like 5 and… 5 light?  I’m mid many projects and this is frustrating. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Rain drips off every helmet. The tension is thick.\n\nNarration (Takasugi’s voice-over) – low, cynical tone:\n\"A ruler without allies is already dead. The rest… is just the ceremony.\"\n\nCut to Shogun Shigeshige, sitting inside, holding his sheathed sword—not to fight, but as a reminder of what he swore to protect. His expression is calm, but his grip is firm.\n\n\n---\n\n[Scene 2 – The assassin steps in]\nA hooded figure (Oboro’s subordinate, a silent Naraku elite) walks into the path. The Shinsengumi form a wall, but the assassin raises a hand — not to attack, but to speak.\n\nAssassin:\n\"Before the curtain falls, I have one question, Shogun Shigeshige.\"\n\nThe Shinsengumi hesitate. Hijikata signals them to hold.\n\nAssassin (steady voice):\n\"If there was a choice… between family and friends… what would you choose?\"\n\nRain intensifies. The road becomes quiet except for droplets hitting the ground.\n\n\n---\n\n[Scene 3 – The answer]\nCamera slowly zooms in on Shigeshige’s face. He lowers his sword to his lap.\n\nShigeshige (gentle smile):\n\"Family is given to you by birth… friends are given to you by life.\nBlood may claim you… but trust must be earned.\nI choose friends… because they chose me first.\"\n\nCut to close-up: The assassin’s eyes flicker. For a brief second, there’s humanity there.\n\n\n---\n\n[Scene 4 – The needle strike]\nBGM fades, only rain SFX\n\nThe assassin steps forward as if offering a handshake — a false gesture of respect. Shigeshige extends his hand without fear.\nIn that moment, a thin glint of steel slides between Shogun’s ribs — the Shinigami Poison Needle.\n\nShigeshige exhales sharply, but doesn’t pull away.\nRain masks the tiny thunk of the needle hitting home.\n\n\n---\n\n[Scene 5 – The final exchange]\nAssassin (soft whisper):\n\"You have no allies at all.\"\n\nShigeshige chuckles weakly, his voice almost lost in the rain:\n\"That’s fine… a friend is worth more than an army.\"\n\nHe stumbles, supported for a moment by the assassin’s grip — then released, collapsing onto the muddy road.\n\n\n---\n\n[Scene 6 – Reactions]\n\nKondo drops to his knees, grabbing Shigeshige’s shoulders, yelling his name.\n\nHijikata’s cigarette falls into the mud, sizzling out.\n\nOkita looks away, his usual smirk gone.\n\nThe assassin quietly melts back into the rain, disappearing without looking back.\n\n\n\n---\n\n[Scene 7 – Closing shot]\nBGM: Gintama OST – “Doushite” (slow strings version)\n\nCamera pulls up into a bird’s-eye shot: the Shinsengumi surrounding the fallen Shogun, rain still pouring. His sword lies in the mud, untouched, unsheathed.\n\nFade to black.\nOn screen text:\n\"Even in the end… he ruled not as a Shogun, but as a friend.\"\n\n\n",

It didn’t say “You can never get this back.” I assumed it was for convenience, so I agreed.  \n\nA week later, I realized Teams wasn’t for me and unsubscribed.  \nFast-forward a month, and I get a notification:  \n**Workspace deactivated.**  \n\nWhen I reached out to support, I was told — for “privacy reasons” — they *cannot* transfer my data back to my personal account.  \nNot even if I pay €68 to reactivate the workspace.  \nThe implication? If I want my data, I must keep paying for Teams *forever*.  \n\n---\n\nThis isn’t just “some chats.”  \nIt’s like spending two years writing a detailed, interconnected encyclopedia of your mind — every chapter referencing earlier ones — and then being told you can only keep reading it if you rent the library every month.  \nIf you stop paying, the doors close, and the books are locked away forever.  \n\nThat’s what my ChatGPT history was: a record of ideas I can’t recreate, images I can’t regenerate, and context that took hundreds of hours to build.  \nAnd now it’s stuck in an account I no longer want.  \n\n---\n\nI understand privacy concerns. I understand separating team and personal data.  \nBut if this data originated in my personal account, paid for with my own subscription, why can’t it be restored there?  \nWhy was there no explicit, unavoidable warning that the transfer was irreversible?  \n\nIf this isn’t resolved, I’ll be sharing my experience so other users don’t get trapped by this “one-way transfer” problem.  \nPeople deserve to know that your years of work with ChatGPT can disappear behind a paywall you didn’t intend to keep.  \n\n#ChatGPT #OpenAI #DataLoss #AIethics #CustomGPT #TechTransparency #SaaS",

If I want my data, I must keep paying for Teams &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just “some chats.”&lt;br/&gt;\nIt’s like spending two years writing a detailed, interconnected encyclopedia of your mind — every chapter referencing earlier ones — and then being told you can only keep reading it if you rent the library every month.&lt;br/&gt;\nIf you stop paying, the doors close, and the books are locked away forever.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s what my ChatGPT history was: a record of ideas I can’t recreate, images I can’t regenerate, and context that took hundreds of hours to build.&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd now it’s stuck in an account I no longer want.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand privacy concerns. I understand separating team and personal data.&lt;br/&gt;\nBut if this data originated in my personal account, paid for with my own subscription, why can’t it be restored there?&lt;br/&gt;\nWhy was there no explicit, unavoidable warning that the transfer was irreversible?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this isn’t resolved, I’ll be sharing my experience so other users don’t get trapped by this “one-way transfer” problem.&lt;br/&gt;\nPeople deserve to know that your years of work with ChatGPT can disappear behind a paywall you didn’t intend to keep.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ChatGPT #OpenAI #DataLoss #AIethics #CustomGPT #TechTransparency #SaaS&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "OpenAI étudie des moyens de générer des revenus supplémentaires, et l'intégration de publicités sur ChatGPT est une option envisagée. Interrogé [sur *Decoder*](https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/758873/chatgpt-nick-turley-openai-ai-gpt-5-interview) , Nick Turley, directeur de ChatGPT, a déclaré qu'il était « assez humble pour ne pas l'exclure catégoriquement », mais a précisé qu'OpenAI devrait « faire preuve de beaucoup de réflexion et de bon goût » quant à la manière d'intégrer les publicités à ChatGPT.\n\n« Nous développerons d'autres produits, qui pourront avoir des dimensions différentes. ChatGPT n'est peut-être pas un produit axé sur la publicité, car il est profondément axé sur vos objectifs. Mais cela ne signifie pas que nous ne développerons pas d'autres produits à l'avenir », a déclaré Turley. « Je pense qu'il est judicieux de préserver les options, mais je tiens également à souligner l'incroyable potentiel du modèle d'abonnement, sa croissance rapide et le fait que de nombreuses opportunités restent inexploitées. »\n\n[*Bloomberg* a rapporté](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year) en mars qu'OpenAI prévoyait de générer 12,7 milliards de dollars de revenus cette année grâce aux abonnements, soit plus du triple des 3,7 milliards de dollars de revenus annuels qu'elle aurait générés en 2024. Cependant, l'entreprise[brûle toujours plus d'argent qu'elle n'en gagne](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337125/suffering-from-success-and-negative-cash-money) et ne prévoit pas de dégager de flux de trésorerie positifs avant 2029. Turley affirme que ChatGPT vient de dépasser les 700 millions d'utilisateurs au total. Selon les derniers chiffres publiés en avril, le service compte[20 millions d'abonnés payants](https://www.theverge.com/openai/640894/chatgpt-has-hit-20-million-paid-subscribers) .\n\n« Je ne considère pas que le fait que la grande majorité de nos utilisateurs soient gratuits soit nécessairement un handicap », a déclaré Turley. « Je pense vraiment que c'est un canal sur lequel nous pouvons nous appuyer pour créer des offres différenciées pour ceux qui sont prêts à payer. »\n\nSam Altman, PDG d'OpenAI, a exprimé des sentiments mitigés quant à l'intégration de publicités au chatbot phare de l'entreprise. Lors d'une [discussion informelle à la Harvard Business School l'année dernière](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVRHTWWEIz4&amp;t=2263s) , il a déclaré que l'intégration de publicités et d'IA était « particulièrement troublante pour lui » et serait considérée comme un « dernier recours » pour ChatGPT. Dans le [premier épisode du podcast d'OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9mjd-65gw&amp;t=982s) en juin, il a toutefois déclaré ne pas y être « totalement opposé ». Ces réflexions interviennent alors que xAI, le rival d'Elon Musk, a des projets plus clairs d' [inclure des publicités dans les réponses de Grok](https://www.theverge.com/news/752906/groks-video-generator-is-free-for-now) à l'avenir.\n\nOpenAI cherche également à générer des revenus en prélevant une commission sur les achats de produits via les recommandations ChatGPT. Turley explique que c'est « une solution que nous explorons activement avec certains des commerçants avec lesquels nous discutons » et que le projet s'intitule « Commerce in ChatGPT ». OpenAI s'attache à empêcher les revenus d'affiliation d'influencer les recommandations de produits ChatGPT, selon Turley.\n\n« Toutes les démonstrations que nous avons en interne le montrent clairement », a déclaré Turley. « Je pense que la magie de ChatGPT réside dans sa capacité à choisir vos produits de manière indépendante, sans aucune interférence, et il est important de préserver cet atout. »\n\nPour l'interview complète, allez écouter le [dernier épisode de *Decoder*](https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/758873/chatgpt-nick-turley-openai-ai-gpt-5-interview) .",

Interrogé &lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/758873/chatgpt-nick-turley-openai-ai-gpt-5-interview\"&gt;sur &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , Nick Turley, directeur de ChatGPT, a déclaré qu&amp;#39;il était « assez humble pour ne pas l&amp;#39;exclure catégoriquement », mais a précisé qu&amp;#39;OpenAI devrait « faire preuve de beaucoup de réflexion et de bon goût » quant à la manière d&amp;#39;intégrer les publicités à ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;« Nous développerons d&amp;#39;autres produits, qui pourront avoir des dimensions différentes. ChatGPT n&amp;#39;est peut-être pas un produit axé sur la publicité, car il est profondément axé sur vos objectifs. Mais cela ne signifie pas que nous ne développerons pas d&amp;#39;autres produits à l&amp;#39;avenir », a déclaré Turley. « Je pense qu&amp;#39;il est judicieux de préserver les options, mais je tiens également à souligner l&amp;#39;incroyable potentiel du modèle d&amp;#39;abonnement, sa croissance rapide et le fait que de nombreuses opportunités restent inexploitées. »&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/openai-expects-revenue-will-triple-to-12-7-billion-this-year\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; a rapporté&lt;/a&gt; en mars qu&amp;#39;OpenAI prévoyait de générer 12,7 milliards de dollars de revenus cette année grâce aux abonnements, soit plus du triple des 3,7 milliards de dollars de revenus annuels qu&amp;#39;elle aurait générés en 2024. Cependant, l&amp;#39;entreprise&lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337125/suffering-from-success-and-negative-cash-money\"&gt;brûle toujours plus d&amp;#39;argent qu&amp;#39;elle n&amp;#39;en gagne&lt;/a&gt; et ne prévoit pas de dégager de flux de trésorerie positifs avant 2029. Turley affirme que ChatGPT vient de dépasser les 700 millions d&amp;#39;utilisateurs au total. Selon les derniers chiffres publiés en avril, le service compte&lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/openai/640894/chatgpt-has-hit-20-million-paid-subscribers\"&gt;20 millions d&amp;#39;abonnés payants&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;« Je ne considère pas que le fait que la grande majorité de nos utilisateurs soient gratuits soit nécessairement un handicap », a déclaré Turley. « Je pense vraiment que c&amp;#39;est un canal sur lequel nous pouvons nous appuyer pour créer des offres différenciées pour ceux qui sont prêts à payer. »&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, PDG d&amp;#39;OpenAI, a exprimé des sentiments mitigés quant à l&amp;#39;intégration de publicités au chatbot phare de l&amp;#39;entreprise. Lors d&amp;#39;une &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVRHTWWEIz4&amp;amp;t=2263s\"&gt;discussion informelle à la Harvard Business School l&amp;#39;année dernière&lt;/a&gt; , il a déclaré que l&amp;#39;intégration de publicités et d&amp;#39;IA était « particulièrement troublante pour lui » et serait considérée comme un « dernier recours » pour ChatGPT. Dans le &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9mjd-65gw&amp;amp;t=982s\"&gt;premier épisode du podcast d&amp;#39;OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; en juin, il a toutefois déclaré ne pas y être « totalement opposé ». Ces réflexions interviennent alors que xAI, le rival d&amp;#39;Elon Musk, a des projets plus clairs d&amp;#39; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/752906/groks-video-generator-is-free-for-now\"&gt;inclure des publicités dans les réponses de Grok&lt;/a&gt; à l&amp;#39;avenir.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OpenAI cherche également à générer des revenus en prélevant une commission sur les achats de produits via les recommandations ChatGPT. Turley explique que c&amp;#39;est « une solution que nous explorons activement avec certains des commerçants avec lesquels nous discutons » et que le projet s&amp;#39;intitule « Commerce in ChatGPT ». OpenAI s&amp;#39;attache à empêcher les revenus d&amp;#39;affiliation d&amp;#39;influencer les recommandations de produits ChatGPT, selon Turley.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;« Toutes les démonstrations que nous avons en interne le montrent clairement », a déclaré Turley. « Je pense que la magie de ChatGPT réside dans sa capacité à choisir vos produits de manière indépendante, sans aucune interférence, et il est important de préserver cet atout. »&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pour l&amp;#39;interview complète, allez écouter le &lt;a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/758873/chatgpt-nick-turley-openai-ai-gpt-5-interview\"&gt;dernier épisode de &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

So I want it to take my resume and include it in the email as well. I want to add a motivational letter as well. And I think this is the hardest part, because the agent has to take the name of the company, check what they do, and write a motivational letter based on their activities and why I want to join them. So it should write it in Word, add the logo, and the name of the person, and export it as a PDF and join it in the email with the CV. The elements I have are Gmail, ChatGPT, Excel, and Word.
